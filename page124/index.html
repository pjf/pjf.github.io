Ben showed me a short video of skateboarders who didn't
quite make
their tricks.  I think councils who don't want skaters
hanging around would do well to take a look at this video. 
Rather than putting up signs saying "No skating, fine $200",
they could instead put up signs saying "Grinding a bar and
failing could permanently separate you from your
reproductive organs."  Any desire I had to do skateboarding
tricks completely drained away from me after watching Ben's
short vid.

<I>Humpy (to Scott):</i>
Well, you tell me.  You're the one who's going
to be writing the crappy code.

<B>Food</b><BR>
One cannot live off wedding cake alone.  I tried that today,
and it didn't make me feel any better.
<P>
<B>Banks</b><BR>
Looks like the banks approve me in principal, but want the
paperwork and the actual house before signing on the line. 
This is pretty much what I expect, and that the banks tell
me that I'm "very comfortably within my limits" is
reassuring.
<P>
The Real Estate agents still need to send me a complete
Section 32, the one they gave me was missing the rates
notices.  Interesting that the notice of rates also usually
contains a valuation by the council.  I wonder if they're
trying to hide something?

Woke up on Saturday with a bit of a sniffly nose.  Ignored
it for the day.  Woke up on Sunday with a more sniffly
nose.  I figured I wouldn't let a sniffly nose tell me what
to do, so I cycled 25-30km and then hauled myself up some
walls.  Interestingly enough this got rid of the sniffles
for a while.  Woke up this morning and the sniffly nose was
back, and it's currently being kept at bay with a mixture of
codeine and other chemicals, which have also dropped my
sensory perception significantly.
<P>
<B>Houses and stuff</b><BR>
Things seem to be going okay.  I'm awaiting a few
phone-calls from the banks to say that they like me enough,
and then I'll be making an offer on the property.  I'm
feeling a lot better about the whole thing now.  Even if we
don't buy the house I feel a lot better off for the
experience, knowing how everything works.
<P>
I'm sorry to hear that <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/ajv>ajv</a> is having
problems getting a home-loan.  If it's any help, the banks
seemed to be much happier when I mentioned that I was
poached by my current employer.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Jacinta managed to climb the "training wall", which is the
first of the big walls out at Nunawading.  This is
excellent, and I'm very proud of Jacinta's efforts.  She was
rewarded with a free mexican meal.
<P>
<B>Fish</b><BR>
Dan Golembo was telling me about fish in Russia that are
harvested for "black caviar".  Apparently one of these fish
can contain as much as 100kg of caviar -- which makes it one
HUGE fish.  Unfortunately it seems that the fish are being
hunted to the brink of extinction, as the black caviar is
such a sought-after commodity, and their natural habitat is
becoming polluted.
<P>
Remind me not to wrestle any Russian fish in the future.

                <B>Work</b><BR>
Yesterday, Sharon "left", which is executive talk for being
made redundant.  Nothing was announced, and I thought the
only reason Sharon wasn't around was because she's in the
middle of her exam period right now.  What makes things
worse is that nothing was said in the staff meeting today,
it was only afterwards via e-mail that this was announced.
<P>
This is a very bad sign, and goes completely against our
"Company Values", which I feel some executives desperately
need to read.  It may well have been that Sharon wished to
move on anyway, but the way it was handled with the rest of
the company was awful.  A few months ago there would have
been cakes, drinks, proper announcements that someone was
leaving, speeches and thank-yous, and generally a chance for
everyone to wish them the best for the future.  I hope this
isn't the start of other employees "disappearing" with maybe
a short note on the news list to testify their passing.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
We finally have our <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net">new webpage</a>
thanks to Ben.  It looks really pretty, although I've just
discovered that it's unreadable unless you have stylesheets
turned on.  The good news is that it looks fine in lynx.
<P>
Unfortunately, the page has very little in the way of
content, although this is not Ben's fault.  The <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/index.old.html">original
design</a> forwarded to me by Ben had lots more content, and
although it was true, it wasn't quite as appropriate.
<P>
Still haven't had a chance to hack at code yet.  Been too
busy with house matters.
<P>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Showed Sofie GnuCash today, in exchange for a promised
massage for Jacinta and myself on the weekend.  Sofie claims
that she can probably skip most of her accounting homework
simply by typing it into GnuCash, and has asked me to
install it on her machine.
<P>
<B>Banks</b><BR>
All the banks seem to be happy to lend me much more money
than I want.  This is probably a good thing.

Dan has returned, and with a beard no less.  As expected,
Dan is showing himself to be a pretty busy guy, and had
requested that we speak to him about nothing but code for
today.  Tomorrow I get to tell Dan about all the fun things
that have been going on while he was away.
<P>
I did a bit of a Dan last Friday, it seems.  When purchasing
things for myself, I almost religiously get receipts.  When
purchasing $100 worth of pizza on behalf of the company, I
forget to get a receipt.  This is going to make getting the
money back a little interesting.  Mind you, I do have a
bunch of witnesses who can personally verify that I came
back with a large tower of pizza which they then proceeded
to consume, so I'm sure I can work something out.
<P>
The Building Committee also elected to have the meeting room
near the dev/systems/support area called the "Daniel
Ingvarson Memorial Lost Article Room" (DIMLAR), in memory of
all the keys/watches/credit cards/wallets/stuff that Dan has
lost in his travels.
<P>
<B>Bad debts</b><BR>
Ghassan Matar, of Hexapods, seems to have completely
dissapeared, along with the money that he owes me.  Luckily
I made him pay for a large sum of the money up front, so I'm
not much out of pocket, and most of the work I did was on
Finance::Quote and which I would have done sooner or later
anyway.
<P>
<B>House-hunting</b><BR>
I have to admit, I really like the house that we've been
looking at.  Jacinta checked with the council, and yes we
can run chickens there.  I've been talking to various banks
and other financial institutions about getting a home loan. 
This is all very exciting, and very scary.  I'm also now
quite aware how much money I have, how much I'm spending,
and how much I'm saving.  Overall that stuff is looking
pretty healthy, although stamp duty and the legal costs of
transferring a house can be quite high.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Getting very interesting.  Junwei and I are very good
friends, which is why I've been kicking his butt out of
neighbouring provences.  Phil and I are also good friends,
which is why he tried to invade me last turn.  I'm also good
friends with England, so good friends that he's letting my
troops stay in his capital city.  Everyone's my friend.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Been doing absolutely nothing recently, which sucks.  Been
spending all my time looking at houses, looking at home
loans, cooking dinner, and defending France from the Italian
hordes.
<P>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
Chickens are way cool.  If we move to Preston, I can keep
six of them, but I'll probably start with five.  I've
decided to call them Ben, Tara, Ian, Sofie, and Daniel.
