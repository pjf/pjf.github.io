                <B>Massive Filesystem Corruption</b><BR>
At about 10am this morning, the power supply on the main
server failed.  This has happened once before, and to be
honest the novelty of fitting a not-quite-the-same power
supply into the case was wearing a bit thin.  I did it
nonetheless, using an old supply from a 386 that had been
hanging around just waiting to be made useful again.
<p>
With the new power-supply in place, it was discovered that
only two of the three disks were responding.  Hmm, very odd.
 Locate faulty disk, remove, check over...
<p>
Oh my.  Chips on the drive controller aren't supposed to
bubble like that, are they?  And boy does it smell bad! 
That's okay, that drive was just /var, and I can live
without my log files and proxy cache.  After all, that's why
I've made backups of the other two disks but not this one.
<p>
Except that /var contains the all-important /var/spool/mail,
/var/cvs, Debian package information, and some databases.  A
bit of an ouch there.
<p>
It was only later that I discovered that I had my last six
years worth of mail also on said hard-drive, since it had
more space than the other disks.  That was the crushing blow.
<p>
As it happens, the blowing power-supply also managed to
cause damage to the motherboard/CPU/RAM as well, since init
would segfault upon startup.  Changing the Mobo/CPU/RAM
fixed the problem.  I'll be testing sticks of memory to see
which ones can be recovered.
<p>
Moral of the story, backup everything, even the stuff you
don't care about, in case there's some stuff you do care
about in there as well.
<p>
It looks like the drive's controller is dead, but the
platters and mechanism inside are still okay.  Tried
replacing the controller with a similar model from a drive
that has busted insides, but to no avail.  It *tries* to
spin the drive up and all, but is obviously expecting
something else.  I think if I can find an identical
controller (old-ish Qantum fireball) I should be fine.  I'm
hoping that one of these professional data recovery joints
has a big box of them.

RIP Boor'yall.  She dropped off the perch (quite literally)
Saturday morning.
<p>
<B>Karaoke</b><BR>
Once again I'm amazed by some of the things that exist in
the world.  On Friday myself and some friends were looking
for a Karaoke bar in order to do a bit of singing.  We found
one promising looking place and entered.  The group had a
couple of Japanese exchange students in it, so we wanted to
find a bar that had a good multilingual selection.  This
place <i>looked</i> like it should.
<p>
Upon entering, I was very politely informed that this is the
sort of bar which has "ladies to sit with you, and since you
have your own ladies, there wouldn't be much point...", and
"yes, it is a karaoke bar, but more of a <i>gentleman's
club</i> karaoke bar".
<p>
We didn't stay, but we did spend a fair bit of time
disbelieving the bar and wondering if it really was true.
<p>
<b>Toy</b><br>
My palm m505 arrived the other day.  It's been very handy in
planning and prioritizing.  It's also shown me that I'm much
much more busy than I thought I was previously.

<b>Quote of the day</b><br>

                <B>Wireless keyboard/mouse</b><BR>
New wireless keyboard and mouse (made by A4 tech) arrived
today, and they work beautifully.  I can type from another
room and all works fine.  Considering the purchae of another
set for the second machine, since they're just so darn handy
and nice to use.
<p>
Apparently each keyboard and mouse has its own serial ID,
which the receiver can remember (and hence excluse all
others).  In theory this lets you run lots of wireless
keyboards/mice side-by-side, and while syncing your keyboard
to your receiver is an easy button-press, I can't quite
figure out how the mouse is done without software.  Even so,
the units have two channels they can operate on, so a second
keyboard/mouse combo should not be a huge problem.
<p>
<b>Mackay</b><BR>
Spent some time in sunny Queensland (Mackay area).  Took me
a day to get used to the heat and humidity, but very much
enjoyed myself after that.  Went ocean rafting, which was a
lot of fun, but I pretty much had to be dragged out of the
water at snorkling time.  Coral reefs are really pretty, and
all the stories you've heard about swimming with schools of
fish are true.
<p>
Also found the most perfect property imaginable up there. 
Hundreds of fruit trees, green pastures, house in perfect
ocndition, permanent creek, and an amazing swimming hole. 
Reasonably priced, too.  Trouble is, we're not really
looking at moving yet, and in order to purchase and move
we'd need to do a lot of employment, financial, and social
juggling.  I also doubt I can get a high-speed, low-latency
Internet connection in the middle of nowhere.  :)
<p>
<b>Work</b><br>
Lots of work to do.  Never rains it pours sort of thing. 
That's good, because it looks like I've got a secure line of
jobs lined up for the next 3-4 months.  No starving here.
<p>
<b>Investment</b><br>
Having looked at the farm in Mackay sparked a big session of
financial planning.  Found some great investment properties
in Mackay (excellent rental returns), but Mackay's property
prices aren't exactly moving, and the average price of units
fell a little over the last year.  Mackay's a small place,
so any statistics on prices there should be taken with a
large grain of salt.
<p>
Looking at properties closer to Melbourne, somewhat because
it's easier to get to (living in Melbourne at all), and
somewhat because of the high population and property value
growth.

After a bit of fiddling, the UPS finally works the way it
should.  Trial-and-error revealed what the functions were
for the various pins on the cable provided with the unit,
and <i>genpower</i> did the rest.  Teddybear (our server)
will now happily shut itself down on power failure and
switch itself (and the switch and the ADSL modem) off.  When
power is restored, everything comes back nicely.  No fscks
involved.
<p>
Anyone who purchases an UpSonic Power Guardian should know
that the attached cable can be treated as an "apc1-nt" by
genpower.  No doubt the Linux software that comes with the
unit also works.

                <B>Olympics</b><BR>
Okay, I've had a few drinks, and I'm watching the winter
olympics closing ceremony.  Having an oh-so-funky loungeroom
PC means that I can share my thoughts with the rest of the
world.
<p>
<I>Dinosaurs</i><BR>
Giant plastic skeletons (with <i>no</i> lip sync) <i>and</i>
KISS immediately afterwards...  Please, gimme a break.  Some
<i>original</i> comedy for the dinosaurs would have been good.
<p>
I'll pay KISS.  We resurrected some really ancient artists
for our closing ceremony in Sydney.
<p>
<I>Earth, Wind and Fire?</i><BR>
By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet!
<p>
I'd never heard of these guys before.  I assume they're a
late 80's group, since their music sounded the same as
everything else from that era.
<p>
<I>Pyrotecnics attached to skates</i><BR>
Okay, *that* was cool, and definitely illegal in Australia.
<p>
<I>Harry Conneck Jr</i><BR>
Most people n Melbourne associate him with a train company
now.  Most people who use the trains don't even remember who
he is.
<p>
<I>Tap-dancing</i><BR>
Had to have microphones in the shoes.  <I>Get Smart</i>, eat
your heart out.
<p>
<I>Pretend rap?</i><BR>
There's some group playing now who look like rappers who
want to be jazz players, and are failing with both.  One of
those all-male groups.  I think that expecting the olypmics
to play good coding music is too much to ask for.  (Yes, I
code to Run-DMC, so shoot me.)
<p>
<i>More dinosaurs</i><BR>
Lame lame lame!  We had giant clotheslines.  Much more
original.  :)
<p>
<i>Cleaning the ice</i><BR>
Sounds like a captain planet song to me.  Jacinta likes it.
 Her musical tastes are still stuck in the 80s.  I don't
know who this Wayne dude is, but he seems to be okay at
skating.  Of course, being the winter olympics, you'd expect
a few decent skaters to be around.
<p>
<b>Interlude - Gold for Australia</b><BR>
We won <i>two</i> gold medals at the winter olympics, the
first two gold medals <i>ever</i> for Australia in the
winter olympics.  Aussie Aussie Aussie!  Oi! Oi! Oi!
<p>
<i>Temptation Island</i><br>
Australian Temptation Island is starting as of next week. 
Personally I don't give a hoot about the show, but it's
traditionally been followed by Buffy, to whom I give many
hoots.  Buffy rocks.
<p>
<b>More Olympics</b><br>
Steve Bradbury is carrying the Australian flag.  Everyone
know Steve, he won the speed-skating.  He's had an awfully
good sense of humour about it all.  Did I mention that
Australia won two gold medals?
<p>
<i>Flags</i><br>
Winches?  <i>Winches?</i>  Back in my day you had to pull
the rope
and tie it off at the end.  Operating the winch looks like
harder work anyway.
<p>
<i>Dinosaurs</i><br>
Shame shame shame.
<p>
<i>Lighting</i><bR>
I'm impressed with the ability to light up the whole stadium
with such clarity.  There must be some very good projection
units there.
<p>
<i>Dinosaurs</i><BR>
When I die, I'm doing the organ donation thing, *and/or* the
medical students in Sydney slicing me up for their
undergraduate degrees.  I don't have a problem with that. 
However, I want it recorded that I *do* object to being
re-animated for an olympic event.
<p>
<i>Security</i><br>
I think this has been the first olympics ever where both the
armed forces and the residing security have been thanked for
their efforts.
<p>
<b>G'night</b><br>
It's certainly time I should get some sleep.  G'night all.
