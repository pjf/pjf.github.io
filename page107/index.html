                <B>Wireless keyboard/mouse</b><BR>
New wireless keyboard and mouse (made by A4 tech) arrived
today, and they work beautifully.  I can type from another
room and all works fine.  Considering the purchae of another
set for the second machine, since they're just so darn handy
and nice to use.
<p>
Apparently each keyboard and mouse has its own serial ID,
which the receiver can remember (and hence excluse all
others).  In theory this lets you run lots of wireless
keyboards/mice side-by-side, and while syncing your keyboard
to your receiver is an easy button-press, I can't quite
figure out how the mouse is done without software.  Even so,
the units have two channels they can operate on, so a second
keyboard/mouse combo should not be a huge problem.
<p>
<b>Mackay</b><BR>
Spent some time in sunny Queensland (Mackay area).  Took me
a day to get used to the heat and humidity, but very much
enjoyed myself after that.  Went ocean rafting, which was a
lot of fun, but I pretty much had to be dragged out of the
water at snorkling time.  Coral reefs are really pretty, and
all the stories you've heard about swimming with schools of
fish are true.
<p>
Also found the most perfect property imaginable up there. 
Hundreds of fruit trees, green pastures, house in perfect
ocndition, permanent creek, and an amazing swimming hole. 
Reasonably priced, too.  Trouble is, we're not really
looking at moving yet, and in order to purchase and move
we'd need to do a lot of employment, financial, and social
juggling.  I also doubt I can get a high-speed, low-latency
Internet connection in the middle of nowhere.  :)
<p>
<b>Work</b><br>
Lots of work to do.  Never rains it pours sort of thing. 
That's good, because it looks like I've got a secure line of
jobs lined up for the next 3-4 months.  No starving here.
<p>
<b>Investment</b><br>
Having looked at the farm in Mackay sparked a big session of
financial planning.  Found some great investment properties
in Mackay (excellent rental returns), but Mackay's property
prices aren't exactly moving, and the average price of units
fell a little over the last year.  Mackay's a small place,
so any statistics on prices there should be taken with a
large grain of salt.
<p>
Looking at properties closer to Melbourne, somewhat because
it's easier to get to (living in Melbourne at all), and
somewhat because of the high population and property value
growth.

                <B>UPS</b><BR>
After a bit of fiddling, the UPS finally works the way it
should.  Trial-and-error revealed what the functions were
for the various pins on the cable provided with the unit,
and <i>genpower</i> did the rest.  Teddybear (our server)
will now happily shut itself down on power failure and
switch itself (and the switch and the ADSL modem) off.  When
power is restored, everything comes back nicely.  No fscks
involved.
<p>
Anyone who purchases an UpSonic Power Guardian should know
that the attached cable can be treated as an "apc1-nt" by
genpower.  No doubt the Linux software that comes with the
unit also works.

                <B>Olympics</b><BR>
Okay, I've had a few drinks, and I'm watching the winter
olympics closing ceremony.  Having an oh-so-funky loungeroom
PC means that I can share my thoughts with the rest of the
world.
<p>
<I>Dinosaurs</i><BR>
Giant plastic skeletons (with <i>no</i> lip sync) <i>and</i>
KISS immediately afterwards...  Please, gimme a break.  Some
<i>original</i> comedy for the dinosaurs would have been good.
<p>
I'll pay KISS.  We resurrected some really ancient artists
for our closing ceremony in Sydney.
<p>
<I>Earth, Wind and Fire?</i><BR>
By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet!
<p>
I'd never heard of these guys before.  I assume they're a
late 80's group, since their music sounded the same as
everything else from that era.
<p>
<I>Pyrotecnics attached to skates</i><BR>
Okay, *that* was cool, and definitely illegal in Australia.
<p>
<I>Harry Conneck Jr</i><BR>
Most people n Melbourne associate him with a train company
now.  Most people who use the trains don't even remember who
he is.
<p>
<I>Tap-dancing</i><BR>
Had to have microphones in the shoes.  <I>Get Smart</i>, eat
your heart out.
<p>
<I>Pretend rap?</i><BR>
There's some group playing now who look like rappers who
want to be jazz players, and are failing with both.  One of
those all-male groups.  I think that expecting the olypmics
to play good coding music is too much to ask for.  (Yes, I
code to Run-DMC, so shoot me.)
<p>
<i>More dinosaurs</i><BR>
Lame lame lame!  We had giant clotheslines.  Much more
original.  :)
<p>
<i>Cleaning the ice</i><BR>
Sounds like a captain planet song to me.  Jacinta likes it.
 Her musical tastes are still stuck in the 80s.  I don't
know who this Wayne dude is, but he seems to be okay at
skating.  Of course, being the winter olympics, you'd expect
a few decent skaters to be around.
<p>
<b>Interlude - Gold for Australia</b><BR>
We won <i>two</i> gold medals at the winter olympics, the
first two gold medals <i>ever</i> for Australia in the
winter olympics.  Aussie Aussie Aussie!  Oi! Oi! Oi!
<p>
<i>Temptation Island</i><br>
Australian Temptation Island is starting as of next week. 
Personally I don't give a hoot about the show, but it's
traditionally been followed by Buffy, to whom I give many
hoots.  Buffy rocks.
<p>
<b>More Olympics</b><br>
Steve Bradbury is carrying the Australian flag.  Everyone
know Steve, he won the speed-skating.  He's had an awfully
good sense of humour about it all.  Did I mention that
Australia won two gold medals?
<p>
<i>Flags</i><br>
Winches?  <i>Winches?</i>  Back in my day you had to pull
the rope
and tie it off at the end.  Operating the winch looks like
harder work anyway.
<p>
<i>Dinosaurs</i><br>
Shame shame shame.
<p>
<i>Lighting</i><bR>
I'm impressed with the ability to light up the whole stadium
with such clarity.  There must be some very good projection
units there.
<p>
<i>Dinosaurs</i><BR>
When I die, I'm doing the organ donation thing, *and/or* the
medical students in Sydney slicing me up for their
undergraduate degrees.  I don't have a problem with that. 
However, I want it recorded that I *do* object to being
re-animated for an olympic event.
<p>
<i>Security</i><br>
I think this has been the first olympics ever where both the
armed forces and the residing security have been thanked for
their efforts.
<p>
<b>G'night</b><br>
It's certainly time I should get some sleep.  G'night all. 
Make sure that you use your powers for good and not evil.

                <B>Cube</b><BR>
The new machine has been dubbed cube, due to its shape,
although it's more shoebox than cube proportioned.  Sound
under Windows was a right pain to get working, and involved
an upgrade from Win98SE to Win2K in order to get a peep out
of the darn thing.  Sound under Linux worked a treat, first
time.  Those people who are curious, it's an FV24 VIA
motherboard with on-board sound.
<p>
The machine is currently sitting in the lounge-room, and has
a TV connection, but no connection to the sound system yet.
 Considering the purchase of a Creative Extigy and a bunch
of high quality surround speakers, but I'm sure that would
be excessive at this stage.
<p>
Again, many many thanks to Ian for providing his wealth of
knowledge regarding hardware and drivers.
