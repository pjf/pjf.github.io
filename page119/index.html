                <B>Houses</b><BR>
Went looking at lots of houses over the weekend.  None of
them particularly took my fancy.  Visited my parents, and
discovered that housing prices in their area have been going
up quite significantly in the last few years.   They're very
happy, as their house is worth quite a bit now.  Even the
pub in the formally dodgy suburb of Spotswood is getting in
on the act.  A few years ago it used to have "Strippers and
Topless barmaids."  Now the sign proudly reads, "Exotic
Dancers and Foxy Bar-Ladies. <I>(Entertainment may of be a
sexually explicit nature which may cause offense to some
people)</i>".  Very upmarket indeed.
<P>
Looked at a house in Coburg that had a great location. 
Perfect cycling distance from the city and close to good
things like Ian, Sofie, Ben and Tara.  Sure, the house had
oh-so-trendy brick-cladding and vinyl-woodgrain coverings
for that true 50's and 60's feel, but it wasn't in such bad
nick.  My main concern is that it's slightly higher than my
usual price bracket, and that the yard (whilst large) is
smaller than I would like. 
<P>
Going to try and look at comparison houses tonight to get a
feel for what else is in the area and if we want to proceed
further with this current prospect.  I'm going to feel much
much better when all this house-buying business is over.
<P>
<B>Sunshine Movie Theatres</b><BR>
Went to the movies with Dan and saw X-men.  Had to go out to
Sunshine to find a cinema that had it showing.  Good movie
provided that you suspend disbelief about anything you know
regarding genetics and mutations.
<P>
The thing that impressed me most were the toilets in the
Sunshine movie theatre.  Very shiny and well-cared for, the
facilties were large enough that not only could they fit an
entire football team, they had enough space to play a game
of football if needed!

A bit of hacking the last few days, mostly some well-needed
tweaks.  Volkers and Keith have recently written new modules
to do lookups at Deutsche Bank and UK funds, and these
should make it into the next release.  I'm very pleased.
<P>
The ASX seem to be doing some weird things with their
website.  I thought maybe they were intentionally objecting
to robot-type things, so I checked their <A
HREF="http://www.asx.com.au/robots.txt">robots.txt</a>
file.  Nope, nothing parsable there, just a really
misleading error message.  (Sorry guys, "Not Found" and
"High load, try again later" have different meanings in most
people's books.)
<P>
<B>The Perl Journal</b><BR>
My draft almost has all the sections filled in, and the
example program is finished and working well.  Hope to have
something reasonable to submit this weekend or early next
week.  Still needs polish, of course.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Friday already?  The week seems to have started just the
other day.
<P>
Dan and Tiff seem to be sick.  :(  I hope they're feeling
better soon.
<P>
<B>Games</b><BR>
X-COM III is great.  Loving it still.

<B>House</b><BR>
Been drooling over some of the land available in <I>Earth
Garden</i> magazine.  49 acres in the middle of Queensland
for less than $AU 10K....  Mmmm, very tempting.  May have to
use a couple of tin-cans on a string for a network
connection, though.  Satellite downlink is also an idea.
<P>
<B>Advogato</b><BR>
Good to see that <A
HREF="http://www.advogato.net/person/bekj">Gossamer</a> has
started a diary.  Hi Bek!   Long time no see.

My opinion of Dan has increased muchly.  He's helped me keep
my sanity during a time when I would otherwise be losing
chunks of it.  I'm very glad he's around.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
ASX have indeed rejiggered their website,  some things for
better and some for worse.  Writing a patch that should fix
things and also provide a good speed boost.

Jon seems quite happy with my draft, and has given me a
green-light to go ahead with a second article.  I'm most
pleased.
<P>
In true perl hacker's fashion, my journal article is also
its own formatting program.  Running perl over it turns it
into editor-in-chief friendly format, whereas leaving it
as-is turns it into author-preferred format.  :)

                <B>Dogs and Sleep</b><BR>
Our neighbour has just got himself a dog, and its favourite
hobby seems to be barking from 4am to 7am outside Gwen's
window.  Gwen's been in Ballarat the last few days, but
she's going to get a bit of a surprise when she comes back.
<P>
The dog itself seems to be quite friendly and nice, albeit
probably quite bored.  Normally I don't mind barking dogs
too much, as I assume they give their owners more grief than
they give me.  However, when it's my immediate neighbour, I
do take exception.  I may have to invest in either a
chew-toy for the dog, some sound-killing earmuffs for me, or
some chocolates for Ian (so he won't mind when I ask to
sleep at his house where it's quiet).
<P>
Of course, my first line of attack is to have some quiet
words with our neighbour -- if I can stay awake that long.
<P>
<B>The Perl Journal</b><BR>
Wrote much of my draft last night, in preparation for first
submission this weekend.  Quite pleased.  It won't contain
how to roll your own F::Q module, as that looks like it will
be well beyond the scope of the article.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
The restructuring looks like it may be a good thing. 
Shirley, who's helping to organise things, certainly seems
to be more than willing to listen to people.  This is a good
thing.
<P>
I'm going to have to call a bunch of places looking into
having the Schoolsnet Xmas party on a boat, train, or other
vehicle.  I suspect I'm going to have to shift my spot on
the party committee to another Dev team member -- I want my
coding time, damnit.  :)
