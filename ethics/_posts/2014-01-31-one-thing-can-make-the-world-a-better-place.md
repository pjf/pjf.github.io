Many people have the dream of being a successful writer.  There's an allure
with having one's work read by others, but on the web the
business of writing has changed. One no longer seeks a publisher, but traffic
and high rankings on search engines. One no longer expects royalties,
revenue is generated from advertisements and affiliate links. Hardly an
hour goes past without a piece of email landing in my mailbox offering "Search
Engine Optimisation".

The language of the web is now monetization, and if that were my goal
you'd see advertisements on this website. But you won't. At least, not the way
you'd expect.

It's commonplace at to prompt the reader to stick around at the end of one's article.
Commonly, this is achieved by displaying links to other articles on the same site.
But my goal isn't to have others read my writing, that's merely a means to an end.
My goal is to *make the world a better place*, and I hope to co-opt my readers
into helping with that.

So at the end of every article, I'd like to direct the reader to whatever
will bring the greatest good. That could be something as simple as a
[funny cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKffm2uI4dk); after all,
making people smile *is* bringing good to the world.  But I think we can do better.

Presently, I'm encouraging people to read
[3 myths that block progress for the poor](http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/) after
{% t Quintrino %} brought it to my attention. It's an incredible piece; well-written and
researched. If you have the time, I strongly encourage you to read and share it.

However my most popular article has to do with how
[beliefs can influence learning](/ethics/2014/01/25/how-to-screw-learning-with-one-simple-belief.html),
with over 35,000 hits in the last five days. I have evidence that it's
particularly popular with parents, so at this very moment time *they* are my
target audience. However I'm interested in *all* suggestions as to what I can
encourage readers to do next.

So, that one thing *you* know which will make the world a better place... what is it?
