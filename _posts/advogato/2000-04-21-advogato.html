Back up to Journeyer again thanks to a certification from <A

<B><A HREF=http://www.gnucash.org/>GnuCash</a></b><BR>
The latest news is that commercial interests have decided
that GnuCash is a good thing, and that some of the lead
developers will be getting paid to add new features.  I
think this is wonderful news -- other people will be paying
to improve a package that I now use on a daily basis.

<B>Finance::Quote and SourceForge</b><BR>
There seem to be a few hiccups with SourceForge and <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/brentn>Brent's</a> CVS
access.  I hope these will get sorted out quickly, as I'm
eager to get a new release out soon, and I'd like Brent's
changes to be included.
