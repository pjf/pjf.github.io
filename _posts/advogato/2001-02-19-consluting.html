<B>Consluting</b><BR>
Well, I'm certainly not short for work.  That's good, I
think...
<P>
<B>Bandwidth</b><BR>
Flakey network links are so annoying.  Bad network links. 
Bad.
<P>
<B>Games</b><BR>
After watching <a href="/person/kevinl/">kevinl</a> and Susan playing a
certain multi-player game, I went and purchased a copy for
myself.  It's heaps of fun, so I'm not surprised that people
get addicted to it.
<P>
<B>Schnet</b><BR>
Visited Schnet last Friday for Kat's birthday. Kat looked
extremely happy, which is great.  Never got my coffee off
Nate, but I know he's a busy elf.  Played lots of hacky-sack
and drank plenty of brewskis at the pub.
<P>
Had Kevin cycle in on Friday for a meeting in the city.  He
looked as if he loved it, so I'm certain he'll be cycling
even longer distances soon.  ;)
<p>
<B>Girlfriend</b><BR>
Jacinta mentioned that I never write about her in my diary. 
Hi Jacinta!
<P>
<B>Buffy</b><BR>
Buffy (and her moping wuss ex-boyfriend of a vampire Angel)
are back on TV.  Yay.
