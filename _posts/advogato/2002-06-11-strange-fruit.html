<B>Strange Fruit</b><BR>
One of the trees in our yard is a <i>Medlar</i> tree, which
is of European descent.  It's hardy, attractive and frost
tolerant.  Despite our tree having been planted less than a
year ago, it's provided us with a good harvest of fruit for
its size, despite the dry summer.  To add to the tree's
praises, it's one of the few fruits which are in season
during winter, with the fruit just reaching the ripe stage
now.  Despite all this, medlar fruit are rarely available
commercially.
<p>
Having had my first experience with this fruit recently,
it's not surprising to see why.  the fruit are about half
the size of my thumb.  While still immature, they're hard,
orange-to-red, and taste something between pear and apple. 
However, while the immature fruit are nice, they're only
slightly less hard than granite.  The "mature" fruit are
quite a different experience.  One day, your lovely reddish
fruit will have turned both the colour and consistancy of
rotten apple.  This fermentation caused by natural yeasts
transforms the hard, inedible fruit into a sweet, soft,
squishy delicacy.  It tastes something akin to unsweetened
apple sauce.
<p>
Picking and transporting the immature fruit would be a
breeze, but convincing the public that something which has
self-fermented is good to eat is another matter.  Eating my
first medlar was quite a leap of faith, all my previous
experiences in puting brown squishy fruit into my mouth have
been bad.
<p>
I'm looking forward to next winter, when I'm sure we'll have
a larger crop and will be able to share this unique
experience with more friends.

<b>Pasta</b><br>
Purchased an inexpensive pasta-maker and have been eating
freshly made pasta for probably two-thirds of all meals
since.  Making pasta is quite simple, doesn't take much
time, and tastes fantastic.  Mind you, using five eggs per
500g of flour makes me happy that we've got chickens,
although with the short days they've dropped to laying only
3-4 eggs/day.
<p>
The pasta-maker, while having a lifetime guarantee, has
already broken the clamp which is used to affix it to the
table-top.  With a molded-plastic handle, I'm not at all
surprised that it didn't last long.  I'll be returning to
the shop in the next few days along with receipt, guarantee,
and poorly made clamp in hand.
