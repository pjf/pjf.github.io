<b>Daniel and Tomoko are having a child.</b><br/>
Daniel and Tomoko have just announced that they'll be having their first child, due in the middle of 2005.  Dan visited briefly yesterday to tell us the good news.
<p>
We had a short discussion on the difficulties of naming children, particularly finding names that sound good across multiple languages.  It was felt that while my suggestion of <i>Spike</i> certainly had character, it was not considered a suitable name, not least because it doesn't sound any good in Japanese.
<p>
I'm certain that Tomoko and Dan will make excellent parents.  In order to allow their existing computer room to become new the baby's room, Dan is even purchasing a high-performance gaming laptop with a 1900x1240 display.  Now that's dedication.
