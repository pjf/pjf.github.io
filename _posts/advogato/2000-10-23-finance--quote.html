<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Minor embarrasment as I discovered that I had to approve my
own posts to the finance-quote-news list.  The company I
work for changing its name as also meant that some of my own
mailing lists no longer recognise me.  Oops.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Settlement is taking place right this very moment, and I
hope to pick up the keys in the next hour or so.  I was
hoping to lie in the sun at the new house, read a book, plan
the garden a bit, and plant some seeds so we'll have
something cropping for when we move in.  If I felt energetic
enough I was also planning on getting some materials to
build the chicken coop/run.
<P>
Unfortunately, after a beautiful weekend, today's turned out
to be very wet and rainy.  It was raining when I woke up at
8am this morning (yay for sleeping in), and it's still
raining now 5 hours later.  No sign of it stopping, either. 
As such, I think I'll have a very wet ride to pick up the
keys, and then spend time wishing I could lie in the sun and
read a book.
<P>
Over the next month we'll be moving things across to the new
house.  Passionfruit vines, rhubarb plants, many pots of
sunroot, seeds and tools, an avagato^W avacado tree and
eventually even furniture.  I've got enough friends and
family wanting to see the new place that I should be able to
get most of the fiddly things over before the big move. 
Somehow I don't think most removalists have much experience
with transporting an 18-month old passionfruit vine.  (Mind
you, neither do I.)

<B>Chickens</b><BR>
The council is sending me out a big set of local regulations
regarding the keeping of chooks.  Interestingly enough, the
maximum allowed without a permit is five, but I already
have six people expecting to have chickens named after them.
<P>
I guess I'll worry more about this as I get more chickens.
To start with I'm planning on getting two bantam australorp
hens, both named "Ian".
