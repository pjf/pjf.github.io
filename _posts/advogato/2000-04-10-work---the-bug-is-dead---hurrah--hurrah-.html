<B>Work - The bug is dead.  Hurrah! Hurrah!</b><BR>
The final bug in a project that had been repeatedly coming
back to bite me has died at last.  The bug has been causing
many people (including myself) grief for many months -- and
would only show itself at the most inappropriate times.  I
think the bug is gone for good, and hopefully exhaustive
testing should back me up there.

Cooper Vertz submitted a patch to extend the Yahoo! quote
facilities somewhat.  Patches always make me happy, and I've
integrated Cooper's change into the CVS source.

Ben's also been bugging me to spiff-up one of my example
programs so he can easily see how his share portfolio is
going.  It was an easy request that I made while waiting for
<I>the world's slowest toaster</i>, one of the quality
pieces of kitchen equipment we have here at work.
