<p><b>Conference talks</b><br/>
Presented my <i>Conference Presentation Mind Control</i> talk last week at the Open Source Developers Club.  It was very well received, with the audience laughing at <i>all</i> of my jokes, even the accidental ones.
<p>
In other matters, the <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> CFP closes today.  Much to my confusion they only seem to accept <i>50 minute</i> presentations.  That's a long time for a talk, and most of what I consider my best material is aimed at the 25-30 minute timeslot.  I've asked to see if there's any  accomodation for smaller presentations.
