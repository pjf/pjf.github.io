<B>Clients</b><BR>
I don't normally complain about my clients in my diary, and I need to be pretty darn cross to even consider it, but some of today's experiences really go above and beyond what I feel is reasonable behaviour.
<p>
I swear that some of my clients must have their masters degrees in "Ignoring Good Advice".  When I write very clearly that they must do either "A" or "B" or their ill-planned and expensive project will die horribly, and the client doesn't understand "A", I fully expect them to execute "B", which they *do* understand.
<p>
Instead, they ignore the problem entirely.  "Works inside the office, it must work for the rest of the world."  I've never felt so close to being inside a <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a> cartoon until now.
<p>
Given that the management of this particular project decided to commit minimal resources, no testing, and release the project before it was even close to being complete, for once I'm not that regretful if it all falls over and dies.
