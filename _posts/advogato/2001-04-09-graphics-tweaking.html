<B>Graphics Tweaking</b><BR>
Working on squeezing a few more FPS out of my machine.  
Discovered the hard way that whilst my Duron 800 is happy 
to run at 8x100MHz, it's unhappy running at 6x133MHz, 
although the later does provide increased memory access 
speeds with my particular motherboard.
<P>
Installing DirectX 8 seems to have attached me to some 
totally poxy FTP site that's crawling along at 4KB/s.  I 
really would have thought that Microsoft would have decent 
mirrors of their software.
