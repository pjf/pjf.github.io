<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Seems the reason why the GnuCash mailing list has been so
quiet recently is that I was somehow dropped off the list
with a number of other developers.  This is very odd.
<P>
Dave reminded me that GnuCash is going into a feature freeze
on Sunday, so it looks like Saturday I'll be coding and
rolling.
<P>
Unfortunately the latest GnuCash from the CVS tree seems to
have a couple of bugs that are making double-entry
impossible.  Since double-entry is the best thing since
sliced accountants, I might have to return to the previous
version for a little while.

Jacinta's liver cleansing diet is doing wonders... I arrive
home each night to a well planned and almost prepared meal. 
Jacinta's even doing the dishes for me so that she has
things to cook with.  I wonder when she'll realise that if
she's doing the cooking then I guess I should be doing the
cleaning...  I hope she doesn't, because I hate cleaning. 
Maybe I can convince Gwen to do the cleaning instead?
