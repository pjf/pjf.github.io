<B>Pain</b><BR>
If you want a painful experience, then try requesting an Australian Business Number, Tax File Number, and other associated registrations using the on-line forms at the Australian Business Registry.  The number of crashes, inconsistant validation, and other glitches meant that I had to make no less than three attempts to complete the forms.  In no case did my 'saved' forms actually save.  Urgh.
