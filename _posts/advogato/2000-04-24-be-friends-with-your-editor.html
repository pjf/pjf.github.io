<B>Be friends with your editor</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.vim.org/>Vim</a> is just wonderful.  As
my most used tool, it does an admirable job in letting me do
what I want with a minimum of fuss.  It's great being able
to re-format quoted text in mail messages (using "gq}") and
knowing that vim will understand that the &gt;'s should be
prefixed to each line, and shouldn't be reformatted with the
rest of the text.
<P>
I don't think that the youth of today truly understand how
important it is to become friends with your editor.  I still
see people who want to do their work in pico.
<P>
I suppose I had an easy transition to vi.  Whereas other
students were used to point-and-drool editors, I'd spent
many years on local BBSs using line editors, and my
favourite game at the time was Hack, which used vi keys for
movement.  All that made the move to vi quite natural.
<P>
<B>Writing code on Advogato</b><BR>
To answer <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/alisdair>alisdair's</a>
question about displaying code on Advogato, I'd personally
make use of the &lt;pre&gt; tags, like this:
<P>
&lt;PRE&gt;
<PRE>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use lib '../lib';
use Finance::Quote;
use Data::Dumper;

<p> # A very very simple script.  Takes a source and a symbol,
# looks it up, and dumps it to STDOUT.  Useful for 
# debugging.

<p> die "Usage: $0 source symbol\n" unless (defined $ARGV[1]);

<p> my $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;

<p> my %quotes = $q-&gt;fetch(@ARGV);

<p> print Dumper(\%quotes);
</pre>
&lt;/PRE&gt;
<P>
Mind you, I've also found that <tt>&lt;TT&gt;works just
fine&lt;/TT&gt;</tt> for small snippets of code.
<P>
Unfortuately, if you go back an edit your diary entry which
used the &lt;pre&gt; tags, you'll find that a whole bunch of
&lt;p&gt; tags have been inserted as well.  Bad Advogato.
