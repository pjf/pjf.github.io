<p><b>Talk like a Pirate Day</b><br>
This Saturday was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>, as well as Software Freedom Day.  This year I sided with the pirates, donned a particularly <a href="http://neilcreek.smugmug.com/Events/Pirate-March-090919/9681123_YmXyk#654143279_2Lz5x">swashbuckling outfit</a>, and joined about <a href="http://neilcreek.smugmug.com/Events/Pirate-March-090919/9681123_YmXyk#653933718_oYjYZ">150 other pirates</a> to march through Melbourne, fight off ninjas, and singing the only <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLsJyfN0ICU">sea-shanty</a> known by every member of our scurvy crew.
<p>
Afterwards, there was the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluebec/3935488869/">world's best pirate cake</a>, crafted by <a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">jarich</a>.

I have some pictures of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622296922081/">the day</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622289316675/">the party</a>, including the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/3936148538/in/set-72157622289316675/">Jolly Tux</a>.
