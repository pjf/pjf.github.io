<B>House</b><BR>
No word back from the real estate agents as to how
negotiations are going.  This is very annoying.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Same company, different name.  Discovered that Kathryn makes
excellent coffee.  Thanks Kat.
<P>
<B>Health</b><BR>
Feeling a bit under the weather, I'm afraid. Sore throat and
aching muscles.  Think I may have picked up the bug that's
been floating around the office.
<P>
<B>Bike</b><BR>
My bike isn't feeling very well at all.  The rear wheel has
partially detached itself from the axle.  Alas this is one
of the things I don't have the tools to fix on my own, so
I'll probably be purchasing appropriate tools and materials
to fix it over the weekend. (Either that or I'll go the easy
way and drop it into a bike-shop for repairs.)
