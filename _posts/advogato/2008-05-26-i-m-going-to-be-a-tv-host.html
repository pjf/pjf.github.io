<p><b>I'm going to be a TV host</b><br>
I was recently contacted by an associate who asked if I'd be interested in appearing as a guest on a new TV show pilot; needless to say, I agreed.  Yesterday I arrived for the recording.
<p>
"How are you feeling?" I was asked.<br>
"Nervous," I admitted.<br>
"Well, you'll be more nervous in a moment."<br>
"Really?  Why is that?"<br>
"Well, instead of having you as a guest, we were wondering if you'd like to be a <i>TV host</i>.  For the <i>whole season</i>."
<p>
Apparently being a TV host is a lot less work than I would have expected, because in a 30 minute episode there's only 24 real minutes of show (the rest are taken up with credits, "words on our sponsors", etc), and after segments and specials and reviews and the like, I'll only be on air for maybe 12 minutes in total.  In an eight hour day of recording it's reasonable that we'll get at least 36 minutes worth of decent footage, so we can potentially knock over half-a-season in a weekend.  Of course, that's all assuming that as a host all I really need to do is look good in front of the camera.
<p>
The show looks like it will be called "The Geek Show", will run on channel 31, and start showing in September.  All this is still a little provisional, since there's quite a few hurdles to jump before then, but it's still very exciting!
<p>
Flame, who some of my readers may know from his OSDC presentations, is the main driving force and creative talent behind the show.  And this isn't the only FOSS-friendly, geeky TV show that I hear is in the works.  However I don't know if I can talk about the others.
<p>
The ironic part of all this is that my channel 31 reception is <i>awful</i>, so I'll probably have to go visit friends to watch the show each week.  ;)
