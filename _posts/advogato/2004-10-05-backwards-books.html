<b>Backwards Books</b><br/>
As <a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/">jarich</a> pointed out to me, it wasn't the <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/books/ttoolkit.html">Template Toolkit</a> (Badger) book that required 6-8 weeks to arrive, it was <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/books/munging.html">Data Munging with Perl</a> that needs to be ordered in specially every time -- just as <a href="http://use.perl.org/~davorg/">davorg</a> had expected.
<p>
The universe is how it should be.
<p>
I had become confused since we had previously shipped a number of <i>Data Munging with Perl</i> books to our clients, whereas this was the first time I recall us shipping badger books.
