<B>Scratching Itches</b><BR>
The POP server at work has broken, and has made my mail
inaccessible with it.  Even though it's the weekend, I've
diagnosed the problem and am seriously considering ringing
up Ian (or some other nice systems person) to tell them to
install an emergency patch so that I can read my mail using
mutt again.
