<p><b>Port Phillip diving photographs</b><br/>
Pictures from our most recent diving trip are <a href="http://pjf.id.au/gallery/diving-2005-04-23/index.html">now online</a>.  Jacinta's done some excellent photography, although our batteries went flat during the second dive.
<p>
All the regions photographed are close to the proposed areas to be dredged as part of the <a href="http://www.portofmelbourne.com.au/portdev/channeldeep/">channel deepening project</a>.  It's unlikely that these beautiful habitats will survive if the project proceeds.
