<B>Mozilla</b><BR>
Have started using Mozilla again.  Went off it a while ago
because it was a little too flakey for my likings.  It's
very pleasing to see just how well it's come along since
then.  Many hip-hip-hoorays for sensible cookie controls. :)
<P>
<B>Shadow</b>&lt;RR&gt;
Shadow's decided to accept me as another rabbit, albeit a
rather large one.  He enjoys grooming my eyebrows,
eyelashes, and stubble.  I can't imagine anything much more
ticklish than having a rabbit groom one's eyelashes.
<P>
<B>Work/Consluting</b><BR>
Aaaaaaiiiiie!  It never rains, it pours.  I've been working
10-12 hour days for the last half-week, trying to deal with
quite a sizeable influx of work that's recently sprung up. 
If all goes as planned (ha!) then it should be finished by
spring, and I can take a nice long holiday again. That would
be nice.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Roofing is done, restumping is done, we have hot water again
(ants nested in the gas booster and blocked up air-intakes,
starter-mechanisms and thermostats).  House is good.
<P>
<B>Homebrew</b><BR>
Our beer is drinkable, although <a href="/person/kevinl/">kevinl</a>'s
tastes better, but has less of a head.  The lemonade is
STILL fermenting, being slow because of the cold weather.
