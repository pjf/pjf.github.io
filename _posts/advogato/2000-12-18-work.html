<B>Work</b><BR>
Been effectively working two jobs.  I'm still doing my day
job (9 working days to go), but at night I'm handling
consultancy stuff.  This means I've pretty much been living
off coffee.  I am <I>really</i> looking forward to the end
of this week so I can get some rest.

Your partner comes to you with the perl script from
Cryptonomicon claiming that she may have found some syntax
problems, but after further discussion it's discovered that
it's just the formatting that's misleading.  Furthermore,
you go on to have a meaningful discussion about how they
could probably have the script run faster if they avoided
the use of $&amp;.
