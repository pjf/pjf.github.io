<B>Talks</b><BR>
I've got a draft due on Monday for my materials for the <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/">SAGE-AU</a> conference to be held this year.  Of course, I'm much more interested in hacking Perl code (and Perl guts) than actually writing the material.  However, I've found lots of interesting things that I didn't previously expect, and which the people at the conference probably won't expect either.  I expect a fun time to be had by all.

<B>Open Source Development Conference</b><BR>
The <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Development Conference</a> is happening this year, on the 1st to the 3rd of December.  I'm on the organising committee, and the Call For Papers is out.  If you'd like to give a talk, we'd love to hear from you.  Check the webpage for more details.
<P>
<B>Training</b><BR>
Teaching in Melbourne this week, Sydney next week, and Sydney again the week after that.  And then there's the final copy of my materails for SAGE-AU, and the end of financial year.  Looks like I'm keeping myself busy, as usual.

<P>
<B>Perl</b><BR>
Working on a new module, Proc::UID, for manipulating a processes' UIDs in Perl.  Nothing special, but it feels a gap which previously required using some messy calls to <tt>syscall()</tt>, XS hacking, or both.
<P>
The rationale behind the module (previously called Secure::UID) can be found <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2004-04/msg00728.html">on the modules archive</a>, and sample code can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-secure-uid/">on sourceforge</a>.

<P><B>Press</b><BR>
Jacinta was interviewed for <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/">The Age</a>, and appeared in it on Tuesday as part of <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/24/1085359551985.html">this article</a> about local open source developers and small business owners.
