<B>The Week of Woe</b><BR>
Last week was one of those weeks that started off well, and then rapidly slid downhill.  It went a little like this:

<p> <dl>
<dt>Monday</dt>
<dd>Public holiday.  I love public holidays.</dd>

<p> <dt>Tuesday</dt>
<dd>Spent the day on-site at a new client.  Mentally exhausting, but otherwise good.</dd>

<p> <dt>Wednesday</dt>
<dd>After a day on-site at a regular client, caught up with a friend who's heading off to Japan for six months.  Afterwards, when cycling home, Jacinta hit a tree-root that had damaged the path and came off her bicycle, slowing her deceleration from 25km/hr by impacting a fence-post with metal bits with her chest.  A nice ambulance took Jacinta and myself to the hospital.</dd>

<p> <dt>Thursday morning, about 2am</dt>
<dd>After hours in hospital, sometimes actually being able to see Jacinta, it's declared that she needs to stay in overnight for another of tests.  I take a walk in the night air to shake off the stiffness of spending forever in a waiting room, and catch a taxi home.  Got to bed before sunrise.</dd>

<p> <dt>Thursday</dt>
<dd>Wasted from the events of last night.  Spent lots of time explaining to clients that my availability is going to be scant over the next few days.  In the afternoon a client calls with their main server dead, just before I'm expecting to head into the hospital to pick up Jacinta.  Manage to solve the dead machine over the phone, and pick up Jacinta on-time.</dd>

<p> <dt>Friday</dt>
<dd>Lots of time spent looking after Jacinta, little time for work.</dd>

<p> <dt>Saturday</dt>
<dd>Jacinta's parents came to visit, along with her sister and brother-in-law.  Lots of attention for Jacinta, although I didn't feel up to entertaining visitors after such a mentally and physically exhausting week.</dd>

<p> <dt>Sunday</dt>
<dd>Much improvement in Jacinta's health.  She's still in the neck-brace (doctors orders), but is up and able to walk to the post-office and back.  However, to top-off the week of unfortunate events, our mobile phone (the new one, with mp3 player, JVM, and infra-red) is gone.  It must have fallen out of Jacinta's pocket when she was visiting the doctor on Saturday.</dd>

<p> <dt>Monday</dt>
<dd>Day spent explaining to all my clients why I'm now half a week behind in my schedules, and why they can't contact me via the mobile.  Rest of the week will probably be spent playing catch-up on tasks.</dd>
