<p><b>OSDC Day 2</b><br />
I missed the first half the day, as I had stayed up very
late the night before and slept in.  It seems <a
href="http://use.perl.org/~cog/journal/31833">I wasn't the
only one</a> who wanted an extra snooze.
<p>
I spent most of the day in the <i>Hallway Track</i>,
speaking with people and catching up on events.  A notable
exception was the lightning talks, which are always worth
seeing at OSDC.  <a href="http://jose-castro.org/">Jos&eacute;</a>
encouraged everyone to start <a
href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a> journals as a way
to attract more international speakers, and singled me out
as an example.  Whether I'm a  good example or a bad one, I
don't quite know.
<p>
I'm presently working on my talks for tomorrow, including
both a lightning talk and my main presentation.  I've also
discovered I need to think more about my talk titles for
multi-track conferences.  A title like <a
href="http://osdc2006.cgpublisher.com/proposals/56/index_html">Human
Interfaces for Geeks</a> works great for a single-stream,
but I feel isn't catchy enough to attract the crowd I'd like
when competing with multiple streams.  Next year I'll have
to use a title like <i>Robotic Ninja Pirates</i>.
