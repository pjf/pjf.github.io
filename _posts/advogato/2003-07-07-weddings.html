<B>Weddings</b><BR>
Congratulations and thank-you to Daniel and Tomoko, who just got married, and very kindly asked me to be best man and witness at their wedding.  I'm very very happy, and very very honoured.
<p>
The wedding was a very small and private affair, with family and a few very close friends present.  However I believe that Tomoko and Dan are planning a much bigger occasion in January, which I'm very much looking forward to.
<p>
Dan's final request as we were all leaving Dan and Tomoko to their privacy was that I run the 1st Edition AD&amp;D game I've been talking about.  :)  Some things just never change.
<p>
<B>Printers</b><BR>
One kind reader asked me how things turned out with the printers, and I'm glad to say that everything turned out well.  They were having an incredibly busy week, and so they can be excused for showing poor customer service on one occasion.  ;)
<p>
<B>Accountants</b><BR>
I'm finally making the plunge and getting an accountant, so I've got someone's brain to pick from time-to-time.  I've already ingratiated myself to them by noting a few problems with a transitional period of their website, but organising a meeting is proving to be very difficult, due to a very full calendar for almost the next three weeks.
<p>
<B>Dogs</b><BR>
Found a small dog on our doorstep Saturday.  Looked after it for a couple of days, and it got picked up by the Lost Dog's Home today, who will hopefully find its owner.  The dog meant that I missed by large delivery of hard-drives since I had to have multiple doors closed between dog and rabbit, and couldn't hear the (already defective) door-bell.
<p>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
After much waiting, Finance::Quote 1.08 is finally out, and available at your local CPAN store.  New quotelets, and a great many bugfixes feature in this new release.  Thanks to everyone who submitted code, patches, ideas and suggestions!
<p>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Still rocks.  The 1.8.x business features really do make a difference.
