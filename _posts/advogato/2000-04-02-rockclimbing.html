<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
It didn't happen for me.  My cold stuck with me over night,
and the infection gave me precious little sleep.  Jacinta
was nice enough to make a trip to the chemist this morning
for some cold and flu medication.  I'm feeling okay now, but
I'm well aware of the codine that's blocking the pain.
<P>
I was very much looking forward to rockclimbing, as I
haven't been in a while.  Ian starts at <A
HREF=http://www.schools.net.au>SchoolsNet</a> next week, so
I should be able to drag him to the <A
HREF=http://www.vicranges.com.au>VicRanges</a> a couple of
nights to make up.
<P>
<B>GnuCash/Quote.pm</b><BR>
My finances have never been better documented, and I now
feel I have a better understanding of why accountants seem
so very sad when money goes missing without reason.
<P>
Have added OO-methods into Quote.pm to provide a nicer
interface.  I've also made an effort to tidy up the
documentation, although there's still a bit of work to go. 
I've applied for space on <A
HREF=http://www.sourceforge.net>SourceForge</a> to develop
the project and keep track of its bugs and foibles.
<P>
<B>Geek Musings</b><BR>
Last night Jacinta asked me if I could remember the first
time I had heard Shakespeare.  After a moment's reflection I
realised that I could indeed remember.  The quote was `To
be, or
not to be...' (the whole passage), and I was young enough to
be in primary school.
<P>
What makes the experience peculiar is that the quote was
read to
me by a voice synthesizer called SAM for the Commodore-64. 
SAM bolstered the C-64 BASIC command set with a function
called SAY, that took a phonetic string and spoke it.  SAM
did a surprisingly good job, and I ended up memorising the
entire passage from having the SAM repeat it to me many
times.
<P>
It dawned upon me that I've been a geek for a very long
time, much longer than I would have normally thought.  I
remember at least two English assignments that I completed
by writing code.  Once I wrote a driver for my C-64 printer
to allow it to print Dwarven runes from J.R.R. Tolkein's
<I>Lord of the Rings</i>.  The second instance I did a rough
port of a space-faring board-game (the name of which now
escapes me) for my `Communications Project'.
<P>
By my estimations I've been a geek since I was eight years
old, when I was given my first computer and actively
participated in a role-playing club I helped start at
Primary School.  I'm glad we had such a forward-thinking
principal back at Williamstown North -- he thought grade
three kids playing Dungeons and Dragons was superb, and made
sure we had a place at lunchtimes to run the games.  This
was at a time when current affairs shows were trying to show
links between RPGs and suicides.
