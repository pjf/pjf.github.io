<B>House</b><BR>
Let's see.  Negotiations have gone like this:
<UL>
<LI><B>9th August:</b> Yes, your offer will be accepted.  No
problems at all.  I'll go and talk to her tonight.
<LI><B>10th August:</b> The vendor has had a fight with her
brother.  She might not want to sell because she wants to
live there herself.  I'll find out for certain and let you
know tomorrow.
<LI><B>11th August:</b> I couldn't contact her, but I really
need to sit down and talk to her in person.  We'll
definitely know by tomorrow.
<LI><B>12th August:</b> The vendor's had some business
problems and needs to talk to her solicitors. She's meeting
with them on Monday.  We'll know for certain then.
<LI><B>13th August:</b><I>Sunday: Waiting for Monday</i>
<LI><B>14th August:</b>The solicitors are in court, so she
can't get in contact with them.  They're definitely not in
court tomorrow, so we'll absolutely know by then.  No
questions about it.
<LI><B>15th August:</b>The vendor hasn't talked to her
solicitors.  She's going to ring them from home tonight. 
We'll definitely know by tomorrow.
</ul>

How hard is it supposed to be just to make an offer on a
damn house?  You'd think that if they went to all the
trouble of putting it on a market and dealing with real
estate agents that you'd actually want to sell!  *grumble*
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Have been elected as chief fire-warden for our floor.  I
think this means that if anyone dies in a fire, it's my
fault.  I'm honoured nonetheless.
<P>
It looks as if we're heading towards proactively fixing
problems before they become huge nasty bugs out in the real
world.  Of course, this might all change next week.
<P>
<B>Bike</b><BR>
Still sick.  Might get time to do something about it
tomorrow.  Definitely by ... Saturday.
<P>
<B>Open Source</b><BR>
Nothing which I've done, although there's been a bit of
interest in people writing new modules for <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/">Finance::Quote</a>,
which will be good if it happens.  (In this case the modules
are for UK mutual funds.)
<P>
<B>ADOM</b><BR>
Have dropped back a couple of versions because gamma 16pre-2
keeps segfaulting, and g15 segfaults even more.  I think it
would be nice if Thomas left debugging symbols in the binary
-- at least then I could use the magic of gdb to say which
function is causing the problems.
