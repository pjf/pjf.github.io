<p><b>Still a roleplayer</b><br/>
Went to visit some friends yesterday.  Had a lovely BBQ, played dancing games later on during the evening, and drooled over some very nice maps and miniatures.  You know your friends are into roleplaying when you find a plushy-cthulu doll with their child's toys.
<p>
However the moment of true enlightenment came when it was realised that not only were we discussing accounting practices, but we were discussing accounting practices so we could write a <a href="http://toee.pjf.id.au/wiki/index.php/User:LedgerBot">bot</a> to automatically calculate <a href="http://toee.pjf.id.au/wiki/index.php/KittyLedger">ledger balances</a> in a <a href="http://toee.pjf.id.au/">wiki for a roleplaying game</a>.
<p>
The bot works pretty well, too. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/WWW-Mechanize-1.12/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm">WWW::Mechanize</a> is a wonderful thing.
