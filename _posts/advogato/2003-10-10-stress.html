<B>Stress</b><BR>
My current level of stress is beginning to interfere with my ability to work effectively.  <i>Everything</i> has to be done before the wedding, and the lack of ability of some people to do tasks to the timelines they have set for themselves has further increased my frustration.
<p>
At this point I really miss being in a regular job, where I can just take a big wad of leave to get married in a relaxing manner, and not have to worry about how everyone else will survive.
<p>
<b>Server Move</b><br>
I have one client who wishes to move a whole rack of servers tomorrow, and is doing so on the understanding that availability of support for the week immediately following the move will be at an all-time-low.  I've provided my professional opinion that it's a very bad idea, but it's going ahead nonetheless.
<p>
No doubt the client will find the matter a learning experience.
