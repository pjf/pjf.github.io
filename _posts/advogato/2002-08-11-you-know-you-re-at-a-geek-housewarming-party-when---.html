A person throws an item into the air and catches it again, and asks at what point in the air it undergoes maximum accleration (trying to trick the non-physics types).  The answers from the floor were (in order):
<UL>
<LI>Duh, acceleration under gravity is constant;
<LI>We're not in a vacuum, so acceleration is most when air-resistance is zero, at the top of the object's flight, when it's stationary;
<LI>The gravitational field is not constant, so ignoring air resistance, the accerlation is at a maximum at the bottom of the flight, when it's closest to the earth.
</ul>
These answers were then discussed and unified into a single answer that the acceleration is greatest at the <i>start</i> of the objects flight, since the gravitation pull is strongest at that time, and the force from air-resistance is in a downwards direction.
<P>
The conversation then proceeded onwards to discuss what effects a lowering of the speed of light would have on the amount of energy present in the universe, an attempt to explain entanglement and its use in quantum communication, and deciding who should play in the first game of twister.

Geeks, all of us.
