<p><b>Fancy a career change?  Become a SysAdmin</b><br/>
Are you sick and tired of being recognised for your hard work?  Do you hate working normal hours that allow you to see friends and loved ones?  Would you like more stress in your day?  Do you want a job where people only notice you when things go wrong, and consider you redundant when things go right?  Do you want urgent and stressful phonecalls while you're on vacation?  Do you want the satisfaction or never being given the tools or time to complete your work properly?
<p>
If you answered 'yes' to all of the above, then you may wish to consider a career as a system administrator.  These brave young souls are ushering in a new era of reliability and stability for systems worldwide, or they would if their requests for monitoring and backup systems were ever taken seriously.
<p>
Yes, as a system administrator you have a lot to look forward to.  Phone-calls at 3am, irate users who don't want to read the manual, and blame for the lack of backups, even though you've spent a year trying to get funding for them.  Best of all, when everything goes well, people will start asking why they even need a system administrator in the first place.
<p>
So what are you waiting for?  Leave that satisfying desk job behind, and join one of the elite ranks of system administrators!  You have nothing to lose but your peace of mind.
