<b>SCUBA::Table::NoDeco 0.02</b><br/>
SCUBA::Table::NoDeco version 0.02 has been released, and will be arriving at a CPAN mirror near you.
<p>
The new version has new functions for finding your maximum time and depth given current nitrogen loading, as well as the PADI no-deco tables.  The PADI tables need more testing, as the risks of transcription errors do exist, so treat with caution.
<p>
The <a href="http://pjf.id.au/dive/calc.html">online dive calculator</a> has also been updated with the new module.
