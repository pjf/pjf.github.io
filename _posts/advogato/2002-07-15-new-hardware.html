<B>New Hardware</b><BR>
My 15/30Gb SCSI DLT tape-drive arrived at last.  Surprisingly easy to set-up.  Worked straight out of the box, no hassles at all.  Fantastic.

Thanks to Ian's very wise advice, I've turned off hardware compression and I'm using software compression (gzip) instead.  After Ian mentioned that he discovered the hard-way that different tape drives can use different compression algorithms, I'm very happy not to make the same mistake.
