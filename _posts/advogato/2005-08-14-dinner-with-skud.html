<p><b>Dinner with Skud</b><br/>
On Friday night I was able to catch up with Skud <i>in person</i> for the first time in many years.  I've known Skud for about as long as I've known Perl (about a decade now), but we stopped bumping into each other once she moved to Canada.
<p>
Dinner was at a small Indian resturant, and included a decent crowd of Melbournites.  The dinner was a perfect example of the small-world syndrome that is rife in Australia's IT communities.  I almost fell off my seat laughing when the lovely person next to me commented that her son wished to attend <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au">The University of Melbourne</a>, as they had a fantastic <a href="http://www.3wanime.org/">Anime Club</a>.  I had <a href="http://www.3wanime.org/index.php?q=about">founded the very same club</a> about ten years ago while still a student.  I felt both proud and a little old at the same time.
