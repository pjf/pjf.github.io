<p><b>Training in New Zealand</b><br/>
Finished a week presenting Perl training courses in New Zealand.  At the end of the last day I handed back my access card, wished goodbye to the students, and promptly locked myself into a back room of the training facility.  After a few phone-calls and only 40 minutes of solitude I was released.

Aside from that, training went quite well.
