<B>PowerTweak: Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Managed to get the all-modular, all-pluggable Finance::Quote
written over the weekend.  It's fully backwards compatible
with version 0.18, is a lot nicer to look at, provides
failover support, and makes it much much easier for people
to write pluggable modules that will work under the
framework.  I'm happy.
