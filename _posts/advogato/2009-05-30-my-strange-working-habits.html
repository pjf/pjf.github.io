<p><b>My strange working habits</b><br>
After far too long on the road, I've been in Melbourne for a whole week.  In theory, I get to spend at least another 10 days here before my next flight, which (provided the last piece of paperwork gets signed) will be to Saudi Arabia.
<p>
This week, when it comes to interesting FOSS stuff, I've done absolutely nothing.  What I've discovered is that when I'm on the road, I keep squeezing in bits of work around the edges.  A lot of my coding gets done in departure lounges, and for my last trips to Canberra, on a bus.  However when I'm home, I can <i>relax</i>.  I can sleep in, be comfortable, and have <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/4712036">long, drawn-out breakfasts</a>.  I have friends, real ones, that I can see and spend time with.  In short, I have all the things of which I've been completely deprived while travelling.
<p>
While this is great for recharging my batteries, it's not great in terms of deliverable productivity.  If you're waiting on me to complete or review a piece of code, you have my most sincere apologies.  Feel free to keep nudging me, it does help.
