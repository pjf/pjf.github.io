<B>Houses</b><BR>
Went looking at lots of houses over the weekend.  None of
them particularly took my fancy.  Visited my parents, and
discovered that housing prices in their area have been going
up quite significantly in the last few years.   They're very
happy, as their house is worth quite a bit now.  Even the
pub in the formally dodgy suburb of Spotswood is getting in
on the act.  A few years ago it used to have "Strippers and
Topless barmaids."  Now the sign proudly reads, "Exotic
Dancers and Foxy Bar-Ladies. <I>(Entertainment may of be a
sexually explicit nature which may cause offense to some
people)</i>".  Very upmarket indeed.
<P>
Looked at a house in Coburg that had a great location. 
Perfect cycling distance from the city and close to good
things like Ian, Sofie, Ben and Tara.  Sure, the house had
oh-so-trendy brick-cladding and vinyl-woodgrain coverings
for that true 50's and 60's feel, but it wasn't in such bad
nick.  My main concern is that it's slightly higher than my
usual price bracket, and that the yard (whilst large) is
smaller than I would like. 
<P>
Going to try and look at comparison houses tonight to get a
feel for what else is in the area and if we want to proceed
further with this current prospect.  I'm going to feel much
much better when all this house-buying business is over.
<P>
<B>Sunshine Movie Theatres</b><BR>
Went to the movies with Dan and saw X-men.  Had to go out to
Sunshine to find a cinema that had it showing.  Good movie
provided that you suspend disbelief about anything you know
regarding genetics and mutations.
<P>
The thing that impressed me most were the toilets in the
Sunshine movie theatre.  Very shiny and well-cared for, the
facilties were large enough that not only could they fit an
entire football team, they had enough space to play a game
of football if needed!
