<b>Gardening</b><br/>
Spent the day in the garden, building a new bed, and chopping up our very vibrant rhubarb into smaller, less vibrant pieces.

<p>
<b>Better Blogs</b><br/>
Those of you reading my journal from <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">pjf.id.au</a> will notice that my journal entries now come with pictures, and will at some point also have galleries attached where appropriate.

<p>
<b>Social</b><br/>
I seem to have been squeezing in a lot of social events recently.  A common friend of Jacinta and myself, Trevor, came back from overseas and so we visited for dinner with a number of his other friends.  Yesterday involved another social occasion (games day) with another out-of-town friend, followed by cocktails in the evening with my sister-in-law, her husband, and a number of mutual friends.
<p>
The better photographs from these occasions will probably be posted in the near future.  Trevor also happened to have a particularly hot flag hanging on his wall, which I hope to add to <a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/">Is My Flag HOT or NOT</a>.
<p>
<b>Conference</b><br/>
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> is just around the corner, and it seems like there's plenty to do.  Our facilities manager is overseas, although I'm not sure everyone realises this, so we're down a member of the core committee.
<p>
<b>Work, Media, Holidays</b><br/>
Last week was extremely busy due to a number of clients wanting work done very quickly.  Next week will be just as much of a squeeze, and also ends in a day of teaching at the end (<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/perlsec.html">Perl Security</a>), and then a week of teaching interstate four days afterwards.
<p>
What made last week just a little more busy was being contacted by a journalist from <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/">ComputerWorld Magazine</a>, who wished to interview me regarding Perl.  Well, I was very glad to oblige, although I spent a considerable time answering the questions as I understand the article they'll be used for is quite significant.
<p>
On the Friday I was asked by the journalist how my photo was coming along.  Photo?  You need a photo as well?  It's amazing how one can be perfectly photogenic in candid shots, but require more than 100 digital photos before some decent candidates can be found in posed photos.  Having the world's cheapest digital camera also doesn't help.
<p>
I'm very much looking forward to the end of the year, after <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">the conference</a> but before <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> runs two courses presented by Damian Conway (<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/aooperl.html">Advanced Object Oriented Perl</a> and <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/textproc.html">Text Processing</a>).  Jacinta and I are intending to have a lovely trip away diving, with no less than 23 dives planned during our time away.
