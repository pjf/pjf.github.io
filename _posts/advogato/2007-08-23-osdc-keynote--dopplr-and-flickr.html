<p><b>OSDC Keynote; dopplr and flickr</b><br />
I've just been asked to present the <i>dinner keynote</i> at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers Conference</a> in Brisbane this year.  This is a great honour, and also just a little bit scary.  Not only will I have a hard time approaching the amazing delivery of Damian's keynote last year, the <i>Da Vinci Codebase</i>, but I'll be standing in the way of hundreds of hungry developers eager for their dinner.
<p>
In other news, after a little delay (ironically due to travel) I've accepted <a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/">Skud's</a> invitation to <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/pjf">dopplr</a>.  If you're a dopplr account holder, then feel free to look me up.  If you need an invite, feel free to ask.

I've also got photographs online from my recent trip to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157601596307807/">Walka Water Works</a> near Maitland NSW.  I didn't exactly take the regular tourist route.
