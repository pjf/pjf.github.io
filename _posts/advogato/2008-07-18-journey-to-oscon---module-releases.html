<p><b>Journey to OSCON / Module releases</b><br>
It's 4:30pm in Oregon, the jetlag is pretty bad, and I'm drinking yet another coffee to perk myself up.  The thing is, I'm still in Australia, where it's stupid-o'clock in the morning.  I figure getting the jetlag out of the way <i>now</i> and sleeping on the plane is going to be better than being awake during the plane and whacked in Portland.
<p>
At least, that's the plan.
<p>
I've spent all of today, and all of yesterday, and all the day before that working on slides.   I'm giving 4.5 hours worth of presentations in tutorials and conference talks, and since my presentations tend to move fairly quickly, I have more than one thousand slides prepared.  I'm still adding them, or at least I was until brain crashed.
<p>
So, as a "reward" for having worked on so many slides, I'm writing code.  At 2:30 in the morning.  I've pushed out a new release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::System::Simple">IPC::System::Simple</a>.  It now has <tt>capturex()</tt> and <tt>systemx()</tt>, which are variants of <tt>capture()</tt> and <tt>system()</tt> that never ever ever use the shell, even if you use one argument.  Thanks to ikegami for encouraging me to implement this.
<p>
In order to make sure my <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/3049">Perl Security</a> tutorial matches reality, there's also a new release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Proc::UID">Proc::UID</a> making its way to the CPAN.  It's mainly a tidy-up of the old code, with better documentation, tests, and build system.
<p>
What I haven't got out yet is <i>the</i> stable release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a>.  Yes, I know it's what everyone's waiting for.  Before I can release it, I want to walk through my TODO list and figure out what really needs doing, and what can be put off.  Unfortunately my spell-point meter is dangerously low from the jet-lag, and casting "comprehend project" is rather challenging right now.  Instead there's a good chance I'll be making a release while over the Atlantic, and pushing that to the CPAN once I touch-down.
<p>
For those hoping to meet me at OSCON, I'll be landing Saturday, but I won't be very sociable until Monday afternoon, after the stress of my tutorial is over.
