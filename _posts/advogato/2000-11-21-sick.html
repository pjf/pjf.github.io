<B>Sick</b><BR>
I seem to have caught the flu that has been doing laps
around work.  It seems that we've never really been able to
eliminate it from the office, it just passes from section to
section and eventually mutates before re-infecting its
original hosts.
<P>
Unfortunately between the flu and the medication to make me
feel slightly more human, I've been left on about 10% of my
regular mental capacity.  Coding is impossible, writing is
difficult, and even <I>Java in a nutshell</i> no longer
seems to be a warm and friendly way of forgetting worldly
pains.
<P>
One of the weirdest things is that the flu is giving me some
very bizzare dreams.  I have odd dreams at the best of
times, but these ones are really setting a new standard. 
Last night I dreamed that my nose contained an XML
parse-tree, which is why it was so congested.  Worse still,
I kept refusing to blow my nose because I needed that data
and it hadn't yet been backed up.

We move in this weekend, which means this week is
busy-busy-busy.  The weekend was spent doing plastering and
painting, and we had half of a solar hot-water service
installed today (the rest is being installed on Friday). 
I've been trying to find a plasterer to replace the cornis
(spel?) in the bedroom, but every plasterer seems to be
booked out for the next two months.  The ones that aren't
busy haven't been returning my calls.

Gill lasted a couple of hours in her attempts to give up,
but AFAIK Kat's been clean for about two weeks now.  I owe
her a little monkey talking-hair-scrunchy for her
willpower.  Good Kat.
