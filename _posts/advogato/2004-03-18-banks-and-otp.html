<B>Banks and OTP</b><BR>
Apparently my bank offers an additional security mechanism on their internet banking facilities where account holders are issued with a device that generates one-time-passwords (OTP) for identification purposes.  It appears to be time based, so one would assume that it's time-synchronised to the bank's computers, and also contains an account-specific shared secret.  Enter a PIN, push a button, and get a token which is valid for that particular minute of the day.
<p>
The use of such a device changes internet banking from depending upon "something you know" (account number) and "something you know" (password), to the much more secure "something you know" (account number/password) and "something you own" (OTP device).
<p>
If all the banks moved to such a system then we could expect the incidence of password phishing for bank details to significantly decrease.  Scammers could potentially harvest a single, short-lived token for an account, but would be unable to recover the physical device itself.  The would significantly reduce the value of an account to an attacker.
<p>
It appears the bank hardly mentions this additional security mechanism to standard clients because they charge $99 for the device in question, and most clients are likely to complain and claim they can go to a different bank which doesn't need OTP technology for internet banking.
<p>
I'm comforted that banks are providing these facilities to their customers.
