<p><b>autodie 1.999_01 (beta) released</b><br>
Today I decided to hack code while sitting under a tree, along the beautiful banks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merri_Creek">Merri Creek</a>.  I promised myself that I'd make a dev release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> before I finished for the day.  Since I had forgotten to bring a cushion, autodie 1.999_01 will be remembered as my first release made due to me having an overly sore butt.
<p>
The new version of autodie is a <i>dev release</i>, which in any other language means "beta".  It won't get installed by default with the CPAN installer, but you can <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pjf/autodie-1.999_01/">download it manually</a> and play with it.  The <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2009/04/msg145908.html">hinting interface</a> is there, and while it may have a few rough corners, it's pretty much all working.
<p>
To release autodie 2.0, I need to walk through the source and tidy up a number of TODOs (there are <i>lots</i> of these), check the documentation is correct (the hinting interface has changed a little since the docs were written), and add a few more test cases.  Patches are welcome for any of these, and best made via <a href="https://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/">github</a> (fork the repo and check out the hints branch), although any form of patch is welcome.
