<p><b>autodie release 1.10_07 - Codename ikegami</b><br>
<i>Don't know what autodie is?  Check out <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=540">the 5 minute video</a> and find out.</i>
<p>
It's Sunday, and that means <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> release day!  The new version of <tt>autodie</tt> is codenamed "ikegami" in honour of the wonderful perlmonk who assisted me in solving one of the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=693338">trickiest problems</a> in getting <tt>autodie</tt> running under its new architecture.
<p>
In fact, the architecture is the big change for this release.  In older versions of <tt>autodie</tt>, different code was used when running under Perl 5.8 than under Perl 5.10, and each code had its own set of bugs and own maintenance that was required.  That meant twice as much work for me.
<p>
The new code employs a single unified architecture regardless of the version of Perl used.  In fact, in the ikegami release the total number of lines of code dropped, rather than increased.  That's a good thing for maintenance, and goes quite some way to paying off a lot of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> I've been accumulating in the project.
<p>
There's also been the regular swag of bugfixes, improvements and tests. You can check out the <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/Changes">changes file</a> for full information.
<p>
<b>You can help autodie!</b><br>
I've still got a big list of things to complete in <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/TODO">my TODO list</a>.  Some of them are large, and some of them are small.  I also need a bunch more test cases, both working and failing.
<p>
If you do wish to help, then feel free to grab the code from CPAN, or take a copy of <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/">the autodie repository</a> using git, and feel free to <a href="mailto:pjf@cpan.org">send me patches</a> or even ask for a commit bit.  I won't bite.
<p>
Also feel free to say "I want to help, but I don't know where to start", and optionally a bit about your skills.  I'm sure I can put you to good use. ;)
<p>
Even if you don't want to help with the project per se, I am very interested in hearing about if you've been using autodie, are planning on using autodie once it's completely stable, or just think it's a great idea.  Likewise, if you think autodie sucks (or needs improvement), I'm also interested in hearing from you, so I can make it suck less.  Drop me a note at <a href="mailto:pjf@cpan.org">pjf@cpan.org</a>.
