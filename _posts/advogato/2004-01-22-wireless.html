<B>Wireless</b><BR>
Thanks to the efforts of <a href="http://www.linuxant.com/">Linuxant</a>, I now have my wireless card running under Linux.  The whole operation was surprisingly easy, and appears to be working quite well.  I haven't yet investigated the range of our dinky AP, but it happily reaches any spot on the property, which is excellent.  I imagine when connected to an 18dBi antenna it will reach quite a bit further.
