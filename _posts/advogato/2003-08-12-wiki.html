<B>Wiki</b><BR>
Sure, I'd heard of wikis before.  I knew they've been used successfully for a variety of tasks, and I've been very impressed by the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.  However I've never before managed a wiki.  That's now changed.
<p>
On the 5th August I set up a <a href="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/">phpwiki</a> for a role-playing game that I was running with nine friends.  The wiki was to form a general resource for the gaming group.  I imagined it would get some use, with people writing for it here and there.
<p>
Since its inception, the wiki has been serving almost 800 pages/day, peaking at over 2000 pages/day only four days after creation, serving 25Mb/day of pages.  The wiki size has grown from about a dozen pages up to 161 over the course of a week.  Wow, and all this to just ten people.  I've been asked to make the wiki public in a read-only format, since many of the players want to share the love.
<p>
I've also set up a wiki for business use, being a great place to jot notes, write proceedures, and pass and store information around.  I may also end up doing a similar thing for my clients, many of which I'm sure would find such a tool very useful.
<p>
<B>Payroll::AU::PAYG</b><BR>
Determine the tax of yourself or your employees in one easy step, using Payroll::AU::PAYG.  I'll be talking on this during tomorrow night's <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> meeting.  The entire module was written during my lunchbreak today, although I expect that the talk will take much longer to prepare.
<p>
<B>Identity Theft</b><BR>
Lots of identity theft has been going on, and it looks like I'm not the only one who's concerned about it.  My bank rang today as a courtesy call to see if I was happy with their service.  Oddly enough, they didn't seem at all surprised when I asked for confirmation as to who <i>they</i> where when I was requested for my name, date of birth, and full address.  The telephone operator immediately provided name, employee number, office building, manager, team leader, and contact phone number.
<p>
Of course, one cannot use the contact number provided by a potential scammer to verify their identity.  A call to the bank's customer service department revealed that they could confirm that the call really was them, but only after doing some paperwork of their own to verify it.
<p>
A good challenge-response protocol for telephone calls would be great here, to allow both parties to verify the identity of the other.  In fact, a good challenge-response system based on sound, cryptographic principals would help remove a lot of identity-theft and identity-confusion.  Rather than needing personally identifiable information (name, date-of-birth, address, ABN/TFN/SSN) and static secrets (passwords), being able to provide a cryptographic challenge and response means identity could be confirmed using once-off session information.
<p>
Of course, you'd need a way to stop a scammer from presenting you with a challenge that they've received in pretending to be you, but I'm sure there's a way to get around that as well.
