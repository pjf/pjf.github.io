This entry contains media elements which are only visible on my <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=470&count=1">main site</a>.
<p><b>Fenwickus of Borg</b><br />
As part of preparation for an upcoming talk my brother-in-law (James Dominguez) prepared a disturbingly realistic photograph of myself after borgification.  It looks like something that you really would find on a Star Trek episode.
<p>
Ironically, I'm looking at making it more "obviously edited" for my presentation, so the audience will realise it's me, rather than just assume it's just another borg photo.

<p><b>New Laptop</b><br />
I've moved my working environment over to a new laptop, one that has a 17" screen and a GeForce 7800 graphics card.  I actually feel guilty when I'm not using the machine for playing high-end games, since it handles them so well.
<p>
The three downsides of the new laptop are:

<ul><li>It has a relatively short battery life (will be fixed with a bigger battery).
<li>It doesn't fit in any of my laptop bags (oops!)
<li>It's missing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick">pointing stick</a>, which on my other laptop I had configured to act as a scroll-wheel.  The integrated-scroll touchpad isn't anywhere as nice to use.
</ul>

<b>Mary@SydChix</b><br />
Mary from Sydney LinuxChix was in Melbourne for a week for academic reasons, and Jacinta and I were lucky enough to be squeezed into her social calendar.  Mary has always been likeable online, with both superb written communication skills and an interest in SCUBA diving, and I was pleased to discover that Mary was also quite likeable in person.  Oddly enough we found much in common regarding the Sydney Linux Users Group, which is ironic since I've never attended a meeting.
