<B>Chickens are also cool...</b><BR>
Because they catch and eat mice.  Who needs a cat to keep your property free of rodents, when you can have a chicken?
<P>
<B>Big file-systems</b><BR>
So, you've got almost a quarter of a terabyte of space sitting around on that RAID-5.  You know, if the machine ever crashes, that fsck is going to take <i>forever</i>.  Wouldn't it be great to drop in a journaling filesystem?  Ext3 sits over the top of ext2, it's easy to setup and configure.  Why not use that?
<p>
Probably because I didn't compile it into the kernel.
<p>
<B>UPS</b><BR>
The UPS wasn't talking nicely to the computer for a while there.  I tried to look-up information on my UPS and the cable it uses, and what settings I should use under genpower.  What was google's top and most useful source for this information?  My diary entry from last year.  Great!
<p>
As it happens it looks like the cable just wasn't seated properly, or some other stupidity.  It all works fine now.
