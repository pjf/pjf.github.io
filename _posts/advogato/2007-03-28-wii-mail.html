<p><b>Wii-mail</b><br />
I have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>.  It's Wii number is <tt>3314 5838 4748 5210</tt> which you can use to send me <i>Wii-mail</i>.
<p>
Of course, you can't actually send me wii-mail until you send me an <i>e-mail</i> containing your wii number, since the console requires both parties to independently establish contact.
