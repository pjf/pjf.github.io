<B>Geeks with Balls</b><BR>
Went to the Apocalypso ball last night, which is the annual
Infinite Images roleplaying club's ball.  The ball had mixed
goth and hawaiian themes, which was odd but worked.  Managed
to catch up with a lot of old friends who I hadn't seen in a
while, and generally had a very good time.  As it was, the
world didn't end due to the planetary alignments, but we
sacrificed a couple of pineapples anyway.
<P>
The ball was <I>extremely</i> geeky...  I think we would
have been the only ones in the world at the time to be
dancing a conga-line to the great 80's hit "Star Trekkin'".

Schoolsnet is currently moving, so I can't access my
e-mail.  <A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/rcp>Ross</a>
tells me that I should go out and get a life for a day.  I
already have a life, I just use e-mail to manage it.
