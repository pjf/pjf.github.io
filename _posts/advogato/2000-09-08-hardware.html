<B>Hardware</b><BR>
Sucks.  My faithful home workstation, ai-chan (a mighty
P133) is showing clear signs that the hard-drive does not
have much life left in it.  It made quite loud and alarming
<I>whirr, clunk, pling, bzzzzt, clunk, zap, bzzt, bzzzt,
clunk, whirr</i> sounds, which in my book translate to
"Backup immediately, I'm going to blow smoke."  An immediate
backup is what I'm intending on doing.
I can't say that I'm at all interested in buying new
computer hardware, but having my hard-drive die is not going
to be fun.  Stupid junk.  I hate hardware.
<P>
New hard-drive probably means a long and boring time waiting
for Debian to re-install.  Sucks hugely.

<B>Gwen</b><BR>
Gwen is leaving us this weekend, back to Ballarat for a week
or two and then off to her new life in Perth.  I wish her
all the best, but it means she's taking her machine that I
use for playing X-COM.  I've backed up the required files to
my dying hard-drive, lucky me.
<P>
<B>Houses</b><BR>
Found a house a few days ago with a nice yard, reasonable
price, close to Ian and a tram.  Looks like it might have a
heritage listing, though.  From my experience of renting my
current heritage-listed property, I know that the telcos
won't touch the damn thing.  Going to have to chase things
up with the council.

<B>General</b><BR>
I want a huge weekend.  I've spent way too much time at
work, or looking at houses, or otherwise doings non-relaxing
things.  This weekend doesn't look as if it will help much
either -- I'll be spending time buying new hard-drives,
visiting my family, and (trying!) to release Finance::Quote
1.02.  Sure, none of them are <I>bad</i>, but they're not
quality relaxation.  Real quality relaxation requires three
days.
