<B>Health</b><BR>
I'm feeling <I>much</i> better now (compared to the previous
few days).  As such I spent a day at work and even wrote
useful code.  This is much better than what happened on
Tuesday, where I spent most of the day in a zombie state.

<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
It's out there, and I've told people about it.  I've made a
file release on <A
HREF=http://www.sourceforge.net/>SourceForge</a>, submitted
details to <A HREF=http://www.freshmeat.net/>Freshmeat</a>,
and will be releasing on CPAN shortly.  With luck I'll get a
number of comments, bug reports, and desired features back. 
Possibly a few flames as well.

<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian's really getting into the whole
SysAdmins-with-weapons-thing.  I think this was something
that he was never allowed to do at DECR because of the
students, and at his conslutancy job because of the
customers.  Hopefully his aim will get better in time.  He
doesn't scare me at all yet.

<B>Ian/Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Ian wants me to go rockclimbing with him tonight.  I want to
go too, but I'm very aware of how little awareness I have of
my surroundings with this virus on me.  I don't want to risk
me being dangerous to either Ian or myself.
