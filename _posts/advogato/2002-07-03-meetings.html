<B>Meetings</b><BR>
My goodness.  A week filled with meetings.  Well, one and a half days is filled enough for me.  Good news is that all the meetings are about giving me regular income for extended periods of time, and the meetings thus far have included dotted lines and signatures.  All very good.
<p>
<B>Flying South for the Winter</b><BR>
Yes, I'm in Australia.  The further south you go, the colder you get.  Despite this, I've got lots of friends who are doing that, except they're all doing it now.  Friends from Brisbane and Sydney, sister-in-law-to-be from Mackay, old workmates from the UK.  I don't know what it is about Melbourne winters (wet, cold, dark) but everyone wants to get a slice of the action before the whole winter thing goes out of season.

<b>More Meetings</b><BR>
Another meeting tomorrow morning.  Lots of homework to do before then.
<p>
<B>Toys</b><BR>
DLT tape-drive arriving soon.   Near-miss with toasty hard-drive has convinced me of the requirement of some heavy-duty backups, and CD-R just doesn't cut it as a backup medium anymore.  Hoping that 300Gb of tapes should last me a while.
<p>
<B>End of Financial Year</b><BR>
I didn't think it was true, but it is, the end of financial year generates a big chunk of work just by rolling around.  One the one hand there are organisations with budgets they need to spend in the 2001-2002 year to justify future budgets.  On the other hand we have organisations who, having spent their 2001-2002 budget, suddenly have money again and wish to spend it somewhere.
