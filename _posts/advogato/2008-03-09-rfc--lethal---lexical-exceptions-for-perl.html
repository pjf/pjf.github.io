<p><b>RFC: lethal - lexical exceptions for Perl</b><br>
I've been scratching a long-time itch of mine, which is that while Perl allows me to use <tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Fatal">Fatal</a></tt> to get subroutines and built-ins to throw exceptions on failure, such a change was always done on a package-wide, rather than lexical (block) basis.
<p>
However with Perl 5.10 we have the ability to fix that, and I've put together a proof-of-concept module that enables exception-throwing subroutines on a lexical basis.
<p>
I'm looking for input into its naming, interface, and concept in general.  Rather than filling up a blog post with it, you can <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=673060">read the node on PerlMonks</a>.
