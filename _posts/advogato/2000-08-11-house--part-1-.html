<B>House (part 1)</b><BR>
Visited the Real Estate agents, wrote out the offer, signed
it, and handed them a cheque for a large sum of money. 
We're pretty sure we've got the house.  I'm very scared, but
also really looking forward to it all.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
My most recent paycheque is wrong.  It doesn't include
reimbusement for pizza.  (Yes, I legitimately claim pizza
purchased for the company every week.)
<P>
<B>Laserdiscs</b><BR>
My laserdiscs arrived, so I'll probably have a few friends
over shortly to help me watch them.  Unfortunately AnimEigo
screwed up my order, leaving out one LD and giving me to two
of another.  Hopefully they'll be able to resolve this in a
satisfactory manner.
