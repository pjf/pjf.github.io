<p><b>A very Perlish Sydney</b><br/>
I spent the end of last week in Sydney, presenting our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/perloo.html">Object Oriented Perl</a> course.  This is one of my favourite courses to teach, as it covers some very interest concepts, and gives me a chance to really show off Perl's object oriented features.
<p>
In the evening of my first day of teaching I got together with members from <a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney Perl Mongers</a>, the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/20084">Sydney Python Users Group</a>, the <a href="http://www.slug.org.au/">Sydney Linux Users Group</a>, <a href="http://sydney.linuxchix.org/">Sydney LinuxChix</a>, <a href="http://www.osia.net.au/">Open Source Industry Australia</a>, and <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/rgnsw.html">SAGE-NSW</a>  to give my <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/speakers.html#fenwickabs">small-business talk</a>.  One of the best things about presenting in a pub is the relaxed atmosphere; no doubt assisted by the presence of amber fluids.  My talk was well received, with much exchanging of business cards and stories afterwards.
<p>
After the meeting a number of members, including myself, travelled to a nearby bar, where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_%28dance%29">salsa dancing</a> appeared to be very popular.  We enjoyed some quite spectacular flaming drinks, of which combusting cinnamon was a prime ingredient.  I'm hoping to get the photographs that some people took of these &mdash; if you took photos at the bar, then please send them in.
<p>
Overall Sydney was one of the most enjoyable travelling/training experiences I've had so far.  Being able to get together with so many local user groups was fantastic.  I'd recommend it to all techies visiting Sydney.
