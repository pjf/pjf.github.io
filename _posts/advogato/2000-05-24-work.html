<B>Work</b><BR>
Too much context switching.  Bugs, packaging, new code,
maintainance, diplomacy, consultation, advice, commitees,
hackey-sack, meetings, lunch, politics.  Seriously
considering dropping Mondays and working Saturdays (or
something like that), so that I can get some work done
without interruption.
<P>
There's one bug that I've wanted to fix for a long long
time.  I thought I had it once or twice, but didn't. 
Unfortunately, despite that project being my "main task", I
rarely seem to have the time to work on it.
