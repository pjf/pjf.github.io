<B>DVDs</b><BR>
I noticed that <A
HREF="http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer">Dancer</a> is
lamenting the region restrictions on DVD players.  I've
heard a rumour that the players in New Zealand do not come
with region restrictions as the NZ government classifies
such stupidities as a trade restriction, anti-competitive,
or something else it believes is illegal.  Yay NZ if this is
true.  Anyone care to confirm/deny the rumour?
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Pain.  Deep pain.  Working on a bug in some archaic code
that seems to have been invented before anyone heard of
encapsulation or local variables.  It hurts.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote and GnuCash</b><BR>
Will be looking at tinkering GnuCash to use the new release
of Finance::Quote.  This should make people very happy.
<P>
I'm also thinking of writing a C interface to the library
(yes, you can do this with perl).
