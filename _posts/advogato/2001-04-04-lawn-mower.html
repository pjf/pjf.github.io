<B>Lawn-mower</b><BR>
After much talk of how long the lawn is getting, and after
much prodding from Jacinta, I finally went out and bought
myself a lawn-mower.  It's low-maintance, self-cleaning,
mulches as well as mows, and instead of producing grass
clippings turns them into a high-grade plant fertilizer.  It
can be operated with minimal supervision, has big ears, and
a cute fluffy tail.  We got one in the stylish colour of
black, and I've affectionately called it rabbit.  Except for
one small incident where its bladder control on the doona
left something to be desired, we've been very happy.
<P>
Rabbit's favourite food is grass, favourite game is
go-to-sleep-behind-the-cannas (where it's almost impossible
to retrieve), and has made it quite clear to us that
shredded newspaper is for its litter tray, and most
certainly <I>not</i> a bedding material.  Rabbit likes to
chew on bits of pruned plum-tree.
<P>
I'm trusting Rabbit not to try and take a bite out of my
network connection as I lie under my plum tree and work.

<B>Ex-work</b><BR>
It would appear that JS, CEO of my previous workplace, has
resigned.  Interesting news.

<B>Poker</b><BR>
Jacinta and I ran a poker night last week which was quite
successful, and we're doing a similar thing tonight. 
Currently our friends are still a little hesitant to be
playing for money, but I'm sure that we'll be able to
overcome most of them soon.
