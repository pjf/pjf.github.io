Nagios is great.  Always good to call a client to let them know something's wrong, before they call you.

<B>X-COM</b><BR>
Running under wine, completely stable.  I have hit one, maybe two hisenbugs, but they appear to be related to the actual program itself rather than the emulation.  Absolutely fantastic.

<B>ToEE</b><BR>
Google has finished indexing the <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/">public mirror</a> of the ToEE wiki.  What's scary is that people are visiting based upon Google searches.  The wiki comes up second on a google search for <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/Grugg.html">Grugg</a>, something which has David most pleased.  I'm not sure why people are searching for "Grugg".

<B>Wedding</b><BR>
You want me to pay <i>how much</i> for flowers?  My goodness, I was told that weddings are expensive, but I really had no idea they would be this expensive.  The reception costing a bit I can handle, they're supposed to.  The photos also costing a bit, fine.  Priest, church, reception, photos.  That's all that's needed, isn't it?
<p>
Noooooo...  There's dresses, and make-up, and suit-hire, and bouquets for all the brides-maids, and a bigger boquet for the bride, and flowery button-hole things for the men, and a cke, and jewelry, and decorations, and rings, and hire-cars, and invitations, and special paper for the invitations, and an increasingly large list of incidentals that I had simply not comprehended before.  Five digits (AUD) worth of wedding expenses easily, before you get to the honeymoon.  Crickey!
<p>
I'm looking forward to the honeymoon.  Tropical waters, SCUBA gear, boat.  No mobile reception.  No ssh via palm-pilot to the infra-red port on the mobile back to my server so I can tunnel out to fix a client's mail problem because they can't deal with word-wrap in filenames.  It's going to be wonderful.
<p>
Talking of honeymoons, I'm going to have to organise agreements with my (hopefully) fill-in SysAdmins, Ian and Josh.

<B>Staff</b><BR>
When the going gets tough, the tough hire new staff and outsource.  Our new software engineer starts next week, and I have an associate of mine working on some data munging and matching work before he's heading off to a new Career in Canada?  <a href="http://infotrope.net/">Skud</a> did exactly the same thing a couple of years back.

<B>Spring</b><BR>
At last!
