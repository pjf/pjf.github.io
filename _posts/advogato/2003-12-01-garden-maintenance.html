<B>Garden Maintenance</b><BR>
Apparently one can be legally obliged to mow one's lawn.  During/after the honeymoon and many days of spring rains and good weather, the grass in the front yard was starting to get a bit long.  What was surprising was a notice served by the council that we were required to reduce its length for fire protection purposes, or face a fine and/or a jail sentance.  Yikes!
<br>
The grass is now cut.

<B>Hints for businesses</b><BR>
When responding to written correspondence from your clients, try not to refer to the training co-ordinator as 'the girl'. This is especially important when said training co-ordinator is the one ultimately responsible in determining whether or not your client decides to pay for your services for the remainder of the year, and hence has a direct impact upon your bottom line.

<B>Weight</b><BR>
I lost about three kilos from the last time I checked.  I'm not chubby, but I've found my belt tighter than I would have preferred sometimes, so losing weight is good.  I put it down to stress more than good exercise habits.
