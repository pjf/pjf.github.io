<B>GnuCash/Quote.pm</b><BR>
Received mail from PAUSE, the <I>Perl Authors Upload
Server</i>, confirming my registration and permission to
submit Finance::Quote to CPAN.  I'll send another mail out
to the Quote.pm authors confirming they don't mind CPAN
distribution.  I'll also need to do a good tidy-up of the
module, and will probably implement OO-methods to make
future maintainence easier.

Went on <A HREF=http://www.criticalmass.org.au>Critical
Mass</a> last night -- my first time in a few months.  We
had a great ride out to St.Kilda, a few drinks at the Espy,
and then retired to <I>Veg Out Time</i> (one of the best
Vegetarian resturants in the area).
<P>
When I got home I discovered that my work machine was not
accessable.  I know Tara was using my machine to play
Half-Life, and I assume she forgot to reboot into Linux at
the end of it.
<P>
I called work (about 10:30pm at night) hoping someone might
still be there to reboot my machine.  To my surprise I
discovered that the reason it hadn't been rebooted was that
Tara (and many others) were <I>still</i> playing Half-Life.
<P>
I was woken by a phone-call at 11:30pm to let me know that
they had finished.  The game must have gone for a
good six hours.  I don't play it for that long on Fridays,
do I?
