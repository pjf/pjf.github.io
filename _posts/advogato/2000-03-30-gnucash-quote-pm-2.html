My patches managed to sneak into CVS without me noticing.  I
hope to give GnuCash a good testing in the morning to make
sure that everything is working okay.  My thanks go to Dave
Peticolas for integrating the patches.

Went to a Peter Kearney concert tonight with Jacinta. 
Jacinta informed me that Peter Kearney was a child singer
and she had sung in a concert with him about 10 years
ago.<P>
I figured that if Peter were a child about 10 years ago,
then he should be a young adult by now.  It was somewhat of
a surprise when I realised my mistake -- Peter was not a
child singer, but person who sings <I>with</i> children.  In
this case he was singing with children from St. Ambrose
primary school.<P>
I had a lot of fun at the concert even though it wasn't
quite what I expected. It reminded me of when I was a young
child and I would (badly) play the recorder at school
concerts.
