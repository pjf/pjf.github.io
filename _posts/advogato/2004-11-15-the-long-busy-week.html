<p> <b>The Long Busy Week</b><br/>
Last week was exceptionally busy, and left me feeling quite exhausted
by the end of it.
<p>
<b>Cats lost and found</b><br/>
On Monday we found a very friendly, and very hungry looking
long-haired cat while out for a walk.  We took the cat home and
provided it with some food and water.  Cats don't normally mix
well with rabbits or chickens (our other pets), so we called
my sister-in-law (Bec) who we knew was looking for a new cat and
asked if she and her husband (James) would be interested in caring for it.
<p>
Bec and James arrived and took an instant liking to the cat, and vice
versa.  It looked lke this was going to be a happy ending.  However,
when they took the cat to the vet for a checkup, they discovered
it was microchipped.  The real owners of the cat were very surprised,
as apparently it had been missing for over three months.  No doubt
this was a happy ending for our cat, but Rebecca and James will
need to find a new kitten to be their friend.
<p>
<b>Teaching</b><br/>
This Friday was spent teaching our
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/perlsec.html">Perl Security</a>
course, and the day before was spent improving the slides and
writing bonus chapters for the course.
<p>

<p> <b>Going Aways</b><br/>
Despite me not having worked as an employee for years, I still
attend the going-away parties for friends at my old places of
employment.  Friday featured quite a number of these, with a 
few shake-ups at old workplaces.
<p>
<b>OSDC</b><br/>
This week was spent writing or finishing my two papers for
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a>, and then Saturday
was spent with Scotty, Amanda, and Jacinta converting everyone's
papers in usable formats and building the first draft of the
conference proceedings.
<p>
<b>Family</b><br/>
Visited Dad on Sunday to help celebrate his birthday, only about
a month late.  Dad cooked us a wonderful lunch, and we spent the
day talking about various topics, and visiting the local attractions
that have changed so much since my childhood.
<p>
<b>Walking</b><br/>
According to my pedometer records, I've taken more than 65,431
steps last week since the 9th November.  According to my
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/walk/">Walk Middle Earth calculator</a>
(still very much in development, with only one part of the
interface currently visible) that's more than the distance
from The Yale to Willowbottom, although it's only the distance
from Hobbiton to the Three Farthing Stone if my steps were
hobbit-sized.
<p>
<b>Sleep</b><br/>
Slept for about 13 hours on Saturday and Saturday evening.  I
was very sleepy.
