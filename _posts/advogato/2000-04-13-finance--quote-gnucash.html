<B>Finance::Quote/GnuCash</b><BR>
A question came up on the GnuCash mailing list asking how
difficult it would be to convert stocks listed on foreign
exchanges into local currency when the stock-prices are
updated.  I thought it was an excellent question and an
issue well worth addressing.
<P>
After a bit of hacking, I managed to clobber out a very
rough (but working) currency converter for Finance::Quote. 
It's going to be changed to make it nicer, but I managed to
write a trivial application which can convert between two
currencies on the command-line.
<P>
Did lots of tidy-up work on Finance::Quote.  Added testing
scripts and fixed the documentation and made a few code
optimisations.  I'll probably release a new version shortly,
with currency-conversion support due for the version after
that.
<P>
The joy of coding has kept me up past midnight.  I must be
getting to sleep.
