<p><b>Perl Tip: Building Perl Executables with PAR</b><br>
I think that PAR, the Perl Archiver, is just fantastic.  Rather than having to worry about dependencies, and getting a whole raft of modules installed onto my target system, I can just drop them all into a Perl Archive and be done with it.  Best of all, using the <tt>pp</tt> command, I can build an executable that will run even without perl installed at all!
<p>
As such, it's no surprise that our latest <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Tip</a> from <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> is on <b><a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2008-05-23.html">Building Perl Executables with PAR</a></b>.
