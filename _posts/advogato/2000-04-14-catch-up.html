<B>Catch-up</b><BR>
This is mainly a catch-up diary.  I've been very busy
recently and haven't had much chance to write in my diary as
much as I'd like.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Just call me bug-boy.  If it's a bug, then give it to me.  I
don't have enough of them already.  If it's a
hard-to-reproduce bug, then that's even better.
<P>
In seriousness it looks like Dancer and myself have a hold
on bug #2.  This is a very good thing.  Clemo has offered to
name his firstborn children after us.
<P>
Dan and Tiff are leaving today to get married.  I wish them
all the very best.  I'm glad they're getting a break from
work at last.
<P>
<B>Rock-climbing</b><BR>
Clemo, Ian and Sam went rockclimbing with me last night. 
Lots of fun, it's so nice to be back on the walls again.  I
was very pleased with some the climbs I achieved, and Sam
showed himself to be a natural climber starting with some of
the walls it took me weeks to work up to.
<P>
We should get another Schoolsnet crowd at rockclimbing next
week, too.  Should be good.
<P>
<B>Dinner</b><BR>
Had dinner with an old friend and watched lots of cute
anime.  Brought back memories of the good ol' days when I
was a poor student and couldn't afford a life.
<P>
<B>Games</b><BR>
Ian's given me HomeWorld to play.  It's a very pretty game,
although I've never been good at real-time strategy games. 
I more prefer the hours of thought and consideration that
turn-based games afford.  In that vein, I've been thinking
of starting a Diplomacy game here at work, depending upon
how interested people are.
