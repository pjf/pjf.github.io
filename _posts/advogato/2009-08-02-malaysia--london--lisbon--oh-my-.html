<p><b>Malaysia, London, Lisbon, oh my!</b><br>
If I seem slow to respond, distracted, or exhausted, here's
why...
<p>
<dl>
<dt>15-18th July<dd>Portland, Oregon
<dt>19-24th July<dd>San Jose, California (OSCON)
<dt>25-27th July<dd>San Franscisco, California
<dt>28th July<dd>On a plane above the Pacific (yes, the
whole day!)
<dt>29-30th July<dd>Home in Melbourne, Australia
<dt>31st July<dd>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
<dt>1st August<dd>London, England
<dt>2-5th August<dd>Lisbon, Portugal (YAPC::EU)
<dt>6th August<dd>Madrid, Spain
<dt>7-10th August<dd>Dublin, Ireland
<dt>11th August<dd>Edinburgh, Scotland
<dt>12-13th August<dd>Darlington, England
<dt>14th August<dd>Leeds and London, England
<dt>15-18th August<dd>Kuala Lumpur, Malayasia
</dl>
<p>
Yes, that's a whole month of solid travel, averaging only
about 2.3 days in any one place at a time.  If you wish to
track my trips (eg, to see if I happen to arrive in your
part of the world), or if you're curious, you can do so via

Right now I'm in Lisbon.  I'm exhausted, and have talks to
prepare for YAPC::EU.  However I suspect a bath and a snooze
is going to trump talk preparation for once.
