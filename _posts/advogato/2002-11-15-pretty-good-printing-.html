<B>Pretty Good Printing?</b><BR>
I've set up one of my clients with PGP, using the plug-in for Microsoft Outlook.  This is working well.  I have progarams which generate and encrypt message, drop them into a mail, and send them off.  The human who receives them double-clicks on the mail, enters their passphrase, and there's the text.
<p>
All was working well, until today the human in question attempted to print the message.  <tt>"Printing of a PGP decrypted or verified message is not supported"</tt>.  Oh dear.
<p>
I agree that sending the message off to the printer may not be  good to start with, network printing protocols are almost invariably sent in-the-clear.  However there is a real and genuine business need to have these documents printed.
<p>
Of course, it doesn't help that I use mutt and GPG for my mail.  For me, it all "just works".
