<p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 2</b><br>
I'm never going to be awake early in the morning so I can visit the
museum if I keep getting back to my hotel at 12:30am, and blogging about
my day.  And yet that's what I'm doing right now.
<p>
Today was my second day in Dubai, and I discovered that Dubai has
westerners, women, and arabs; they all hang out in the malls.  After
sleeping in again (goodness, I was tired), I decided to go to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mall_of_the_Emirates">Mall of the Emirates</a> (the one with indoor skiing in middle
of the desert), and then make my way by foot to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_al_arab">Burj Al Arab</a>
area, which I estimated was a 2.5 km walk, and hence pretty easy.
<p>
I caught a taxi, as the distance was much too far to walk, and I had no
idea which bus to catch.  I had a great chat with the taxi driver; he was
from Nepal, had moved to Saudi to work (not far from where I was
working), and was now in Dubai.  I asked if he had any family here,
and he laughed.  Apparently Dubai is so expensive, especially with
rent, there's no way he could support a second person; the plan is to
work here as long as he can stand it, and take his savings back home.
<p>
It seems that with the global financial crisis (GFC), while Dubai still has
lots of taxis, it's lacking the tourists who normally use those taxis.
The GFC and the drop in tourism is something I'd heard from a few sources
now, and it's clear that a lot of Dubai depends upon the tourist trade.
<p>
When I stepped into the Mall, it felt like stepping into America.  It
had American shops, American food, and American people.  Actually, as
I was to discover after talking to a few of them; the majority of the
westerners were from the UK.  Almost everything in the mall had prices
similar to what I'd pay back home, and like most malls, most of it
were things I had absolutely no interest in at all.
<p>
Luckily, I found one of my objectives for the day, and that was a free
wireless hotspot.  I eventually found the access point, it's just
outside the cinema, and the SSID is "yournetworkname".  I used it to
call home (again, hurray for VoIP), and after a good chat ran down
my laptop battery.  Unfortunately, I didn't bring my external battery
(it's heavy!), so any remaining communication had to be done via
a hand-held.
<p>
The other discovery I found in the mall was an arabic gift shop, which
was filled with local wares and tourists.  Amazingly, I actually
enjoyed browsing here; this certainly wasn't stuff I'd see in
Australia (or anywhere else), and the prices were extremely
affordable.  There was also a hilarious collection of art-work out the
front of the door.  Words can't do these justice, so you'll just have
to look at the photos (coming soon) and see.
<p>
I purchased a selection of gifts and while often it was easy for me
to say "$x will like this", I discovered that was very hard when
$x = 'jarich'.  Eventually I went for the shotgun approach, and got
her one of everything.
<p>
Somehow, after two calls home, some IM chats with friends, a selection
of gifts, some photographs of the ski slopes, and some chats with the
locals, it had got rather late, so I decided to set out on my walk.
This was made more challenging by the fact that my laptop had a flat
battery, and that's where my maps were located, but since the Burj
Al Arab is the world's tallest building, it's not hard to spot and
walk toward it.
<p>
I should correct myself there, it's not hard to spot.  Walking toward
it <i>was</i> hard, since there were huge multi-lane highways, and
construction work, and no obvious way to actually walk there.  I could
(and in hindsight, <i>should</i>) have got a taxi there.  It would
have cost AED 10 (about $3.50), which would have been a bargain for
the XP I would have gained visiting it and the nearby Souq Madinat.
<p>
As it was, I ended up walking fruitlessly in what was essentially the
wrong direction.  Eventually I stopped for some food outside the
<i>Lulu Hypermarket</i>, where the serving staff of the fast-food
place I frequented were delighted that I was from Australia, and
gave me detailed information about the busses in the area, and were
generally awesome.  They were from the Phillipines, and collectively
were the nicest people I've met all trip.  It's just a shame the food
wasn't.
<p>
Having found the bus (AED 2 rather than AED 45 for a taxi), I looked
forward to being able to see all the huge towers along
<i>Sheikh Zayed Road</i>, which is the home of some of the most
opulent hotels and establishments.  Consequently, I was dreadfully
disappointed when it decided to go down Al Wasl Rd instead, which
doesn't have much sightseeing at all.  Eventually the bus pulled into
the Bur Dubai bus station, which I had never been to before, but which
I knew was walking distance from my hotel.
<p>
Unfortunately for me, I didn't know in which direction my hotel lay,
and due to an inefficient hashing algorithm being used in my brain,
I couldn't recall the name of the street with my hotel, either.
I knew I was staying in the Ramee Apartments, but apparently Ramee
is a chain with a number of Dubai hotels.  Plus, my laptop battery
was dead, so no checking maps for me.
<p>
Luckily for me, I was in Dubai, so I just walked across the road to
the mall (Dubai has plenty), plugged in my laptop, and fired up Google
Earth with all my cached maps.  The bus stop was only 600m from my
hotel as the crow flies.
<p>
On walk to my residence, down a surprisingly deserted street, a man
approached me from an alleyway.  From experience I figured this
probably meant he wants to sell me a <i>100% genuine fake rolex</i>,
although for a moment where I wondered if people get mugged in
these parts, and there was a reason nobody else was walking down this
street.
<p>
"Excuse me, but do you speak French?"  Okay, I <i>really</i> didn't
expect that.  I admitted I didn't, and wondered where this
conversation would go.  "Oh.  Then do you have a hotel?"  I started
to wonder if French-speaking, homeless tourists were common in these
parts.  "Yes, I have a hotel.  I'm walking there now."
"Oh.  Are you sure?  Because if you need a room, I have a room you can
rent.  It's very nice."  "No, really, I do have a hotel."  "Oh, okay,
where are you from?"  "Me?  Australia.  How about you?"  "I'm from
France."
<p>
Suddently, the conversation made sense.  My new acquaintance was over
here working, and with rent prices being so high, he was looking for
a room-mate.  He would have been most happy with someone who could
speak French, but I'd do.  If I was unhappy with my hotel, or sticking
around in Dubai, he'd be happy to split the room costs with me, 50-50.
<p>
We had an interesting chat, and I pointed that I could see my hotel
and was about to turn down one of the streets toward it.  We wished
each other a good night, and I dropped past the 24 hour
<i>Super Happy Mart</i> to replenish some supplies for breakfast.
<p>
Tomorrow I should try to wake up early and visit the museum, but based
on prior experience I'm not sure if I will.  Failing that, my plan is
to catch a bus or taxi to <i>Jumeirah Mosque</i>, check out the beach, and
then walk through the back-streets of Al Bada to Sheikh Zayed Road,
which should put me in the heart of the "down-town district".  I'm sure
I can find myself some trouble from there.  ;)
