<B>Cartoons</b><BR>
I'd love to go back to cartooning -- there is so much
material at Schoolsnet to base a strip on.  The only problem
is that while it's very funny to me, someone (possibly me)
might get sued if I were to put it all into stick-figures
and speech-bubbles and release it to the world.

My goodness, I have 90 minutes all to myself to hack code. 
This is a very very good thing.  Hopefully I can get a good
amount of framework testing done, tidy up the backwards
compatibility bits I'm not 100% happy with, and maybe even
start on a hackers guide.  I very much want a hackers guide
to make it easy for people to write new modules.
