<B>Honeymoon</b><BR>
Back from Honeymoon.  Had a fantastic time, lots of diving (11 dives in total), snorkling, swimming, lazing around on beaches, and all those other good honeymoon things.  Reading material on flights was an excellent book discussing the Australian stock-market, and Kiyosaki's <i>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</i>.  Haven't finished either, but Kiyosaki's book is far too light on information for my tastes.  If I wanted storytelling, I'd be reading a novel.

Discovered that Ian and Lizy have been doing an excellent job of looking after the business while I was away.

When it's not quite so late at night I'll write a much longer log of my exciting travels.
