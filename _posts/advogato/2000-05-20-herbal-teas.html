<B>Herbal Teas</b><BR>
Sofie thinks my newest herbal tea smells like bong-water. 
She still drank some of it, so it couldn't have been that
bad.

<B>Private health cover</b><BR>
Spent a good chunk of the day comparing various private
health insurance packages.  The Australian government is
going to charge me a big slab of money for earning chunks of
cash but not getting private insurance, so I'm hoping to
rectify that shortly.
<P>
What worries me is how much the government is pushing
private health insurance.  All Australians are entitled to
free public health insurance, called Medicare.  Higher
income earners pay a Medicare levy to help pay for this, the
even higher income earners pay an extra levy if they don't
have private insurance.
<P>
Recently the government has introduced a 30% government
rebate on private health insurance.  This, combined with the
extra levy that was recently introduced, is a big incentive
for the higher-earners to get private insurance.  That's all
fine with me, but I'm a little worried that it might be the
start of a "ramping-down" of public health cover.  I don't
want to see Australia increase the rift between the medical
services available to the rich and the poor.
