<B>Liver-Cleansing Diets</b><BR>
Jacinta has recently started the liver-cleansing diet (LCD),
which <A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/rcp>Ross</a>
seems to have had good success with.  I'm often skeptical of
diets (there are too many "fad diets" which are quite bad),
but a bit of research shows that the LCD appears to be quite
sensible.
<P>
One thing which made me very happy is that I can feed
Jacinta lots of wild herbs that I've collected because the
diet recommends them as healthy and healing foods.  I don't
think I could have ever convinced Jacinta to drink dandelion
tea or eat fresh sowthistle otherwise.

<B>I am Fabio -- the most beautiful man in the world</b><BR>
I've been doing my <A
HREF=http://search.corbis.com/default.asp?i=11330682&vID=1&rID=101>Fabio</a>
look (beautiful brown curly hair
waving over my shoulders) the last couple of days.  While
this seems to have gained the appreciation of the Support
team at Schoolsnet, it's also brought back an old problem of
mine -- gender misidentification.
<P>
It seems that whenever I've freshly shaved, people seem to
get my gender wrong. Last night it was the taxi driver, in
the past it's been shop assistants, waiters, and a variety
of others.  This gets mildly annoying, because I am actually
male.
<P>
I've considered growing a beard a few times, but I've found
that (1) it itches when I try to grow a beard, and (2) my
beard grows only in spots and looks really stupid.  So much
for that idea.

<B>Rockclimbing and Comedy</b><BR>
Karen came rockclimbing with us on Sunday, and generally had
a fun time once she had got past a few teething problems
with the belay harness.  With luck she should become a
regular climber.  Afterwards some of us went to a comedy
show in South Melbourne, which was very enjoyable. 
Unfortunately Karen seems to have picked up a bit of a cold
from the whole experience.
<P>
My private health insurance say that they'll pay for 70% of
my rockclimbing fees.  I'm sending them off a claim today to
see if they keep good to their promise.

<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
We have a hackers guide.  :)

<B>Work</b><BR>
New people, every day.  We have a new person in the Support
team who I haven't met yet.
