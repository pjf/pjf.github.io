<B>The late Mr. Fenwick</b><BR>
What an interesting evening.  Jacinta rang me from Spencer
Street train station asking if I could cycle in and give her
some papers that she left at home.  Sure, I said.   The
train didn't leave for another 25 minutes so I thought I had
plenty of time.
<P>
I arrived with a whole 20 seconds before the train left, and
despite me running up and down the length of the train
looking through the windows, I couldn't spot Jacinta.  :(
<P>
<B>Money, Money Everywhere, But Not A Bank That
Thinks</b><BR>
To top the evening off, I discovered that my new ATM card
wouldn't actually let me access my account.  I don't see
what logic the bank sees in issuing me with a card that
doesn't actually do anything, and being the holiday season I
suspect that I won't be able to find out until Wednesday.
<P>
In the meantime I have the sum total of $11.90, all of it in
small change.  The rest of my money I spent on coffee --
very good coffee -- which more than makes up for my lack of
hard cash.
