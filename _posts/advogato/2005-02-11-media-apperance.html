<p><b>Media Apperance</b><br/>
An interview with me has appeared in a feature article in this week's <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/">ComputerWorld</a> magazine (9th February, 2005).  Unfortunately it's only in print, so I'm not aware of any legal copy of the article available on-line.
<p>
The feature compares different development platforms (Java, .NET, C++, and Perl), and there's no prizes for guessing which one I'm talking about.  There's a reasonable amount about Perl 6 (since lots of the questions were about 'new features' and future directions), quite a bit on the flexibility of Perl, and some time spent dispelling the myth that Perl is only suitable for small projects.
<p>
There's even a mention of <a href="http://perlmonks.org/">PerlMonks</a> and <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> for those looking to learn Perl.
