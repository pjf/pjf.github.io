<p><b>Rabbit</b><br/>
No luck in finding our lost rabbit, Shadow.  We've looked throughout the property, bombed the surrounding area with leaflets, and put up posters.  We're in the process of contacting animal shelters, in case he's turned up at one of them.
<p>
I'm not confident that we'll get a result, especially since we can't find any means by which he would have left the property.  We're also at a loss as to what could have happened.  A fox attack is a possibility, except Shadow would have had plenty of warning hearing the fox as it came over the fence, and has a great many fox-proof hiding places to which he could have run.
<p>
<b>Handover</b><br/>
Our primary sysadmin is dissapearing for six weeks, so some of today is going to be spent doing handover for all of our customers' systems.  I'm expecting to have a very busy two months coming up.
<p>
If you live in Melbourne, are experienced with Debian, and have six weeks of immediate availability for irregular sysadmin work, then now's a good time to get in touch.  Moonlighters need not apply.

<b>Paperwork</b><br/>
Jacinta tidied my desk and sorted my paperwork into stacks based upon priority.  This makes me feel much better, but I can still expect to spend most of the day sorting it out.
