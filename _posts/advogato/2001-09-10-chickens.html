<B>Chickens</b><BR>
Been building a chicken coop for our chickens-to-be.  It's
taken a bit of time to get around to it, but the coop is
looking good.  It's built almost entirely from stuff that
was hanging around our yard (or our neighbours).  The
previous house owner seemed to have quite a collection of
junk built up, including some 6ft steel pipes that are very
heavy and very strong, and have made an excellent support
for the frame.
<P>
Been able to make use of cool things like cobalt tipped
high-speed drilling bits, and molybidium (spel?) alloy
tin-snips. Discovered that power-drills work much better
when you run them in forward, rather than in reverse.
<P>
Hoping to get a few Isa Brown chooks from <A
HREF="http://www.ceres.org.au/">CERES</a> once the coop is
complete.  Failing that will probably investigate local
breeders.
