Earlier this year I wrote about being diagnosed with Bipolar II. Since then I've had a lot of time to see what it's like to be on my medications, and pick apart just how my brain seems to work. Today I want to do a deep dive into my experiences, both because it's good for me to talk about my mental health, and because I want to de-stigmatise mental health discussions in general. I've also got an additional diagnosis that's been added to my character sheet.

I'm on two medications for my treatment of bipolar: sertraline (a common antidepressant and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, also known under its brand name Zoloft) and olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic).

### Sertraline

My experience with sertraline started well, but perhaps hasn't had all the effects I've hoped for. While it's filled in my depressive pits (where I'd literally just curl up in despair), it hasn't stopped my capacity for depression. October was particularly hard, and my depressive episodes still come with an enormous lack of energy, lack of motivation, and general listlessness.

My sertraline dose has increased since I started to combat the depression, and while I've been mostly side-effect free, SSRIs come with the risk of [SSRI-Induced Indifference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989833/), where one finds themselves more emotionally disconnected and less caring than usual. I *definitely* had this, and while it's hard to say if it's from the sertraline or depression, lowering my sertraline dose seemed to help.

The irony that my anti-depressant gave me depressive symptoms is not lost on me.

Not caring was both easy (because I don't care), and hard (because I *want* to care). As someone who's long held strong beliefs and motivations, it's confronting to find myself not really energised about anything. It's even worse because a lot of how good I feel about myself is related to how productive I've been. With my internal motivations so low my productivity has suffered.

### Olanzapine

I have a very mixed relationship with olanzapine. On one hand, it's been *amazing*. I sleep better, the tension in my back is gone, I'm more relaxed, and much less irritable. Its effects are very fast (usually noticeable in half an hour), and my dose is very low (a mere 1.25mg/day).

On the other hand, olanzapine has a tendency to wipe out my motivation and leave me somewhat sedated. That's fine if I've had a long week and want to relax with a book, but as someone who's already struggling with motivation, having a drug that lowers it even more is not ideal.

The other thing that olanzapine does is lower the number of thoughts going through my head at once. While this can be a very good thing in terms of staying focused or reducing unwanted thoughts, it also makes it harder to think about complex problems. That's been particularly challenging for me, because the way in which I deal with a lot of stress and anxiety is by reasoning about it.

When I'm feeling anxious or worried about something my response is often to examine it in detail. I'll try to quantify it, think up cases I've missed, to map out different futures, and to attach probabilities to each. I'll generate action plans and contingencies, and I'll put these into my task-tracking system. Being able to identify, anticipate, quantify, and constrain risk is one of my primary ways of feeling safe. Olanzapine gets in the way of doing this, and so while it's *supposed* to have a calming effect, if I'm worried about something it can have the opposite.

This isn't restricted to olanzapine; anything that interferes with my thought processes (alcohol, pot, antihistamines) can make me more agitated if I'm worried or stressed.

The good news about olanzapine is that it's an absolute champion at halting manic or mixed episodes.
