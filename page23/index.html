                <p><b>The social life of a Perl trainer</b><br>
I'm blogging every week about Perl, not least due to the presence of
a <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html">competition</a> that encourages me to do so.  However this week I'm not
dealing with technical matters, I'm dealing with personal and social ones.
<p>
There's a common perception that I have a massively social job.  I
travel around the world and teach people Perl.  I speak at many conferences
each year.  I attend a multitude of user-groups.  Sometimes I do consulting, and
when I do, the things I'm fixing are often people related: internal education,
politics, and culture.  In any given year I meet work closely with <i>hundreds</i> of new people.  People are my life and my job.
<p>
Despite that, sometimes it feels very lonely.
<p>
The problem isn't with the quantity of people I meet, but the quality of
my relationships with them.  When I meet course attendees we spend a lot
of time together, but it's one-to-many time.  At conferences I have
more quality social time, but it's only for a couple of days, and my
talk preparations often get in the way.  Often there are <i>so
many</i> people at conferences I want to meet or catch up with that I
only spend at most a few hours with each person, regardless of how
much I like them.
<p>
Due to my lifestyle, I meet many wonderful people who I would <i>love</i> to spend more time with.  The problem is that so many of them live in other cities, or other countries, or have travelling or lifestyle schedules similar to me.  In fact, my travel schedule can really screw things up.  Last night there was a gathering of four of my most favourite people in the whole world, and in my home town.  I wasn't there, because I was on an yet another airplane.
<p>
Back when I had a "real job", or even when I did regular consulting, I didn't
have these problems.  I'd see the same people each week at work.  I'd go
to the same places for lunch.  There'd be regular social activities
that I could attend, because I wasn't changing city every week.  While
having a regular job may not help with the breadth of friendships, it
certainly helps with the depth of them.
<p>
I've been teaching and living this lifestyle for many years, so why am
I noticing this just now?  Well, it's partially because I'm so busy
right now.  The global financial crisis has kicked our business into
overdrive.  A combination of hiring-freezes, and the need to do more
with less, has caused Perl courses and consulting to be very popular.  Sometimes I joke about being in a different city every week, but recently it's been the norm.
<p>
However the big wake-up was that how I've been associating with my students
has changed.  Years ago they were learning Perl because it was cool, and
fun, and because doing things in Perl was so much easier than doing things
in almost any other language.  Those students were were bright, eager to learn,
and full of questions.  That almost always meant that I got along extremely well with them socially, as well as academically.  These days we still get those
students, but many people are on our courses because programming is their job,
not their passion.  They don't always self-identify as geeks, and I find that I have an awkward time relating to them socially.
<p>
Having good students is one of the most rewarding parts of being a teacher,
and is what got me hooked on teaching before I even graduated from
University.  I'm unlikely to give up the teaching any time soon; I enjoy
the travel, the freedom, and it's certainly hard to argue with the money, but I do find that ephemeral socialisation is really starting to tick me off.
Sometimes I wonder if I should actually go back and teach at University,
purely for the social highs associated with doing so.

                <p><b>autodie status update</b><br>
I just looked through my blog history, and discovered the last release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a>, I've blogged about was version 1.99!  Since then, there's been nine releases!  For those of you new to my blog, autodie is a lexical pragma that allows Perl's built-ins to throw exceptions on failure, which can take your error-handling from cumbersome to simple.
<p>
There's been a lot of changes in those nine releases, and the <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/Changes">Changes</a> file documents all the significant ones.  There are nicer error messages, better coverage of Perl's core functions, fewer rough edges, and lots more tests.  If you're not one to go reading Changes files, I can assure you that upgrading to 1.999 is pleasant and surprise-free.
<p>
I've had a few people tease me about the silly version number, 1.999 threatens to have 1.9991 as a next release, but this will not happen.  The next version of autodie will be 2.000, and this actually represents a significant change.  There's no backwardly incompatible changes, but there is a new feature which greatly extends autodie's ability to detect failures in non-core subroutines.
<p>
Presently, one can write:

        <div class="p-summary">
            
                <p><b>Rotorua</b><br>
In February as part of my New Zealand adventure I made it to KiwiFoo (aka BaaCamp).  The trip to KiwiFoo was an adventure in itself, with Jacinta and myself giving talks at Wellington Perl Mongers and Waikato LUG, and spending a short time in Rotorua (our "tourist day").
<p>
Rotorua was unfortunately heavily touristified, and I noticed a few of the locals calling it "RotorVegas".  It wasn't hard to see why; there were lots of ways to separate the tourists from their cash, and many of the local attractions felt very artificial as a result.  It didn't help that I knew the local geysers were so "reliable" due to an ample addition of soap powder at the times they're supposed to blow.
<p>
Somewhat repulsed by the highly commercial offerings, we went looking for some more authentic experiences off the beaten track.  Some time walking around one of the geothermal areas revealed a brightly coloured steaming pool behind a "No Entry" sign.  I wondered just how hot the water could be, and my scalded finger assured me it was almost at boiling point.  Pipes from a nearby hotel snaked their way into the pool, obviously making use of the ample heat it provided.
<p>
After a much longer walk, Jacinta and myself found our way to the Redwoods, which made for an excellent few hours hiking.  With sore feet, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Closed">Conan the Detective</a> drink bottle we discovered along the walk, we returned to the hotel.
<p>
Our hotel had the rather tacky name of "GeyserLand", but true to its name we had an excellent view of a mud pool and geyser directly outside our hotel window.  The heat in Rotorua was oppressive; the air was humid, we were experiencing a "heat wave", and the local geothermal activity naturally added to both.  The hotel room didn't have air conditioning, so staying in didn't appeal.
<p>
The hotel had a swimming pool for guests, which seemed attractive, but it didn't remain open particularly late.  It also had "spout pools" which could be hired for a modest fee, but the hotel services guide contained no information about these might be.  I figured they were some sort of geothermally heated bath.
<p>
Jacinta and I went to the desk to find out a little more and potentially hire a pool, and were told we couldn't hire one, because they were just about to close.  "Oh no," I cried with my best pout, "We've travelled all the way from Australia, and this is our only night in Rotorua...  I had <i>so</i> hoped to enjoy a thermal pool before I left."
<p>
A few minutes later we had access to a "spout pool", free of charge, because the hotel couldn't monitor our usage after they'd closed up reception for the night.  Consequently, we also had access to the pool for as long as we wanted.
<p>
The pool ended up being the highlight of the entire day.  Rather than a tiny thing that would only fit two people, this would have comfortably fit six unfriendly people, or almost twice that in friendly people.  Hot water (presumably heated underground) falls from a spout into the pool, which would be waist-deep if you stood up, but which contains seats at just the right level to bring the water to neck height.  It was clear that the water wasn't being recycled, it was just pumped in fresh 24 hours a day.  I felt rather jealous of New Zealand's ample water supplies; in Melbourne it hadn't rained for two months, and water usage came with tight restrictions.
<p>
My dive computer (which I routinely wear instead of a wristwatch) told me the water was about 36'C, which made it <i>lovely</i> to relax in.  If I ever return to the hotel, I'll be sure to bring a number of friends and a bottle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake">sake</a>.
<p>
The next day we were off to Waikato (Cambridge and Hamilton) en route to Auckland and then Warkworth.  We went and visited a local nature park (with an obligatory kiwi tour) and had a nice lunch in town.  Everything looked pretty good until we got onto the bus, where I had discovered we'd booked our tickets for the wrong week.  After a little pleading and cajoling with the bus driver and assurances that we wouldn't even be in the country the next week, we were allowed on anyway, despite our tickets being invalid.
<p>
Waikato was another adventure again, and one I hope to discuss in my next journal entry.

I'm currently sitting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington">Wellington</a> airport, New Zealand.  It's the most civilised airport I've ever seen.  Rather than standing in a queue forever with tickets, there are kiosks which weigh one's bag and prints baggage and boarding passes.  One then places the bags on a conveyor belt, and walks to the departure gate.  It's wonderfully laid back, with no screening for weapons, sharp objects, or dangerous liquids like toothpaste and coffee.  At the departure lounge there are plenty of power points, and a completely open access point (albeit with the odd SSID of <i>router</i>).  In about 15 minutes I'll be on my plane to I'm on my way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorua">Rotorua</a>, where I'll be a tourist for a whole 24 hours.

For those who haven't been following my <a href="http://identi.ca/pjf/">dents</a> or trips on <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/pjf/public">dopplr</a>, I'm ostensibly in New Zealand for <a href="http://baacamp.org/">Baa Camp</a>, but that's not until the weekend.  Until then, I'm travelling, and mostly staying with geeks while doing so.
<p>
For the last two nights, I've been staying with <a href="http://grantmclean.vox.com/">Grant</a> and Anna McLean, who have a beautiful house and the nicest and best behaved kids I've ever met.  Grant runs the local <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/">Wellington Perl Mongers</a>, where both Jacinta and myself had the honour of speaking last night.
<p>
As I discovered, Wellington also has the most civilised Perl Mongers group I've ever seen.  They provide beer and munchies <i>during</i> the meeting.  I was very glad to see both <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a>, <a href="http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/">Andrew</a>, and <a href="http://vilain.net/">Sam</a> at the meeting; Wellington is certainly spoilt when it comes to having distinguished people.  It's also spoilt for cafes; I could hardly walk five steps in the city centre without encountering a barista.
<p>
My next public appearance will be at <a href="http://www.wlug.org.nz/MeetingTopics.2009-02-12">Waikato LUG</a> on Thursday.  If you're in the area, I'd love to see you there.
