                <p><b>Teaching Perl in Saudi Arabia</b>
After what seems like an almost endless amount of paperwork, visa applications, immunisations, negotiations, contracts, travel agents, and administrivia, I'm about to fly to Saudi Arabia, to teach Perl to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco">the world's biggest oil company</a>.
<p>
Why are they learning Perl?  Well, as best I can tell, they're using it for data munging of geological data.  That's got a familiar ring to it, in fact I've been seeing a big growth of <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=566">Perl in Geoscience</a> recently.
<p>
On the way back I'm planning to spend a couple of days in Dubai, just because it sounds like such a bizarrely opulent part of the world.  World's biggest hotel.  World's biggest indoor ski slope.  World's biggest shopping mall, and certainly the closest thing we have to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/magrathea.shtml">Magrathea</a>, with Dubai creating artificial islands in the shapes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands">palm trees</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(archipelago)">the world itself</a>.  I also hear the diving is pretty good.

                <p><b>My strange working habits</b><br>
After far too long on the road, I've been in Melbourne for a whole week.  In theory, I get to spend at least another 10 days here before my next flight, which (provided the last piece of paperwork gets signed) will be to Saudi Arabia.
<p>
This week, when it comes to interesting FOSS stuff, I've done absolutely nothing.  What I've discovered is that when I'm on the road, I keep squeezing in bits of work around the edges.  A lot of my coding gets done in departure lounges, and for my last trips to Canberra, on a bus.  However when I'm home, I can <i>relax</i>.  I can sleep in, be comfortable, and have <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/4712036">long, drawn-out breakfasts</a>.  I have friends, real ones, that I can see and spend time with.  In short, I have all the things of which I've been completely deprived while travelling.
<p>
While this is great for recharging my batteries, it's not great in terms of deliverable productivity.  If you're waiting on me to complete or review a piece of code, you have my most sincere apologies.  Feel free to keep nudging me, it does help.

                <p><b>StepMania Heaven</b><br>
I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.stepmania.com/">StepMania</a>, a free and open source dance game in the style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a>.  For years I'd played with the <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-7uq3-71-1i-77-1-49-en-15-dance+mat-84-j-70-1jkd.html">soft plastic mats</a> that tend to come with these games for home console systems.  These are great for the starting player, and easily fold up for storage, but as one's dance moves become more dynamic and energetic, they rapidly start to crumple, crease, and slide.
<p>
For years, I'd dreamed about having a rigid dance platform.  Last year, at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a>, I was lucky enough to take home <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/2237511281/">a plywood and cork tile</a> homebrew creation, courtesy of Tamara Olliver, who constructed it as part of a talk at the conference.  The mat worked pretty well, and I even <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=529">added some retro buttons</a>, but I had problems with it mis-firing.  The mesh connectors would fray with heavy use, and then tend to stick together.  I still had dreams of a metal dance mat, but the cost of shipping to Australia put these way out of the price range I was willing to spend on one.
<p>
Well, a couple of weeks ago, I found an eBay supplier who was selling metal dance mats in Australia, with a delivered cost of $150 after some creative investigation and use of the "best offer" button.  The mats looked like they were clones of <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-7uq3-71-88-84-j-70-29f.html">TX-1000 series</a>.  Having not seen an offer like this for years, I purchased two.
<p>
Now, the TX-1000 is the cheapest, nastiest metal dance mat one can find, and I knew this, but they still beat any soft mat one cares to play with.  The original ones used tiles that would "float" on a bed of foam, with the corners removed and a heavy-duty bolt in each position, to ensure each pad couldn't move away from where it was supposed to be.  This is similar to many arcade setups, and works pretty well.  That meant that while all the components in these pads are cheap, but at least the engineering principle was sound.  One could expect the tiles to last a couple of months before they needed to be replaced.
<p>
Of course, what <i>I</i> got was a cheap-and-nasty version of an already cheap-and-nasty pad.  Rather than each pad having four bolts (a total of 24 in total), there are only four bolts on the entire board.  Rather than the tiles "floating" on foam, they still have the foam underneath, but each tile is now supported on three edges by the side of the dance platform, and internal supports.  The pads tiles now flex to make contact with the underlying sensor.
<p>
At first, this doesn't sound too bad, until I tell you that the <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-7uq3-71-88-84-j-70-3ie.html">tiles are acrylic</a>, which is not an impact resistant material.  Because the tiles are now flexing, their lifespan goes from months down to days.
<p>
So, I now own two awesome metal dance mats, each one with a number of not-so-awesome broken tiles.  This isn't as big a deal as one may think, the tiles have a rubber underlay that holds them together, so the dance mat still continues to work more-or-less as before.  However the nice 'foot-feel' is impaired, and with enough damage, they tiles may actually become unusable.
<p>
I'm not too upset about this.  For $150 a mat, I didn't expect a first-class dancing platform, and the mats are <i>extremely</i> easy to service; the tiles are easily removed and replaced, and the electronics are simple to get to.  So, I'm looking to replace each tile with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a>, also known as <i>bulletproof glass</i>.  There are some fun <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsls5ZPCUnE">acrylic vs polycarbonate</a> videos that demonstrate the difference in impact resistance, and I'm pretty sure that polycarb will be tough enough for what I need.
<p>
I've found a supplier, but unfortunately polycarb seems to come in a standard engineering size of 1.2 x 2.4m, which is about three times what I need.  If I had six dance mats, or could just pay for the materials I need, then each tile comes to about $6 each, including professional cutting, which I think is a great deal.  I'm calling around to see if I can find a supplier who's got an off-cut, or maybe a salvage yard that has some odds and ends.
<p>
To complete my StepMania setup, yesterday was spent modding furniture.  Our lounge-room AV cabinet would fit our old CRT television, but not the new Plasma TV that Jacinta won at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers Conference</a> last year, and as such the new TV has mostly been sitting in storage.  After some discussions on the best way to succeed, and with the help of a new electric <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(power_tool)">jig-saw</a>, the TV cavity in the cabinet was enlarged, the ends painted, and the new TV fitted.  Jacinta did all the hard cutting, since she actually has wood-working experience, and I don't.
<p>
The new set-up is <i>so much nicer</i> than previously.  The TV takes inputs from just about anything, and forwards its audio to the stereo, so there's much less futzing around with splitter boxes.  It also takes an analogue VGA input, and while my laptop's analogue VGA doesn't seem to want to talk to anything else, it loves talking to the TV.  As such, the laptop has been spending a lot of time connected, with StepMania being played, or media being watched.
<p>
My only problem is that I feel sad when disconnecting the laptop.  My lounge-room changes from a totally awesome StepMania and gaming heaven into just a lounge-room, with just a TV.  I think now is the time to finally put together a dedicated <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> box.  My plan is to convince Jacinta that she wants a new laptop, since her old laptop is showing signs of stress on the internal VGA cabling, it's the prime candidate for being re-purposed.
<p>
So, if you happen to be in Melbourne, and have a source of 2-3mm polycarbonate, or feel like showing me your awesome dance moves, now's a good time to visit. ;)

                <p><b>autodie 1.999_01 (beta) released</b><br>
Today I decided to hack code while sitting under a tree, along the beautiful banks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merri_Creek">Merri Creek</a>.  I promised myself that I'd make a dev release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> before I finished for the day.  Since I had forgotten to bring a cushion, autodie 1.999_01 will be remembered as my first release made due to me having an overly sore butt.
<p>
The new version of autodie is a <i>dev release</i>, which in any other language means "beta".  It won't get installed by default with the CPAN installer, but you can <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pjf/autodie-1.999_01/">download it manually</a> and play with it.  The <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2009/04/msg145908.html">hinting interface</a> is there, and while it may have a few rough corners, it's pretty much all working.
<p>
To release autodie 2.0, I need to walk through the source and tidy up a number of TODOs (there are <i>lots</i> of these), check the documentation is correct (the hinting interface has changed a little since the docs were written), and add a few more test cases.  Patches are welcome for any of these, and best made via <a href="https://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/">github</a> (fork the repo and check out the hints branch), although any form of patch is welcome.

                <p><b>Perl for Geoscience</b><br>
Traditionally our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl courses</a> have been targeted at people who work with computers as a job.  Developers, software QA, sysadmins, database admins (DBAs), and the like.  However, recently I've noticed a sharp increase in course bookings from people who <i>don't</i> have computers as their primary job.  In particular, we've been seeing a lot of bookings from people who work in geoscience, and hydrology in particular.  These bookings aren't just from within Australia, I'm seeing international interest as well.
<p>
It seems that Perl has gained a reputation as being a good cross-platform language for when you have a big hunk of data in one format, and you need to get that data into another format.  Geoscience folks deal with lots of data, and they seem to be perpetually massaging it (often by hand, or in a spreadsheet) to get it into the format they need.
<p>
Perl is certainly well-suited for this task, and people learning Perl for the purposes of data transformation have been a mainstay on our courses since we first started running them.  However I've found our new wave of interest particularly challenging to teach.  They don't have any programming backgrounds, so I can't draw analogies to other languages, or even assume they'd know why subroutines are a good idea.  They may have never used a command-line before, so the concept of providing command-line arguments is completely foreign.  Even the way they think about data is different; for many students in my last class, the idea of hierarchical data (such as a tree) was a completely new concept; in their world, data had always been tabular in nature.
<p>
I'm thrilled that I'm able to teach people new skills, and I'm sure some of the students from my classes will be going back to their workplaces and replacing some of their colleagues with very small Perl scripts.  However I'm deeply worried that their understanding will be too incomplete.  I teach a very <i>modern</i> Perl course, with a lot of focus on best practices, maintainability, validation, and theory.  While I know some of my students can grasp this a little, others are still struggling with consistent indentation, and can't grok the long-term concepts at all.  I fear they'll under-use the CPAN, reinvent the wheel, copy-and-paste from bad examples, fail to use revision control, fail to document their code, pile on technical debt, and do all the other things that inexperienced programmers do.
<p>
I don't know what to do about this.  For this group of people, I think I'd get great feedback (and more bookings and money!) if I taught a class that focused on short-cuts and quick'n'dirty programming, since my students can grasp those short-term gains; they can't as easily grasp the long-term ones of maintainability, testing, source control, and correctness.  One could argue those long-term goals aren't important for my new clients, since they're writing code for "once-off" tasks, but as most of us know, there's an awful lot of <i>once-off</i> code that's still being used decades after it was written.  I feel the concepts of code quality and maintainability are <i>more</i> important for inexperienced programmers than anyone else, since they're the ones most likely to make these mistakes.  I'd rather not teach at all than teach bad practices.
<p>
I think we'll probably extend our most popular course to five days, and slow down the material; I've got enough cool bonus material to fill an extra day if we have a class of more computer-oriented students.  I've also found myself dropping entirely some of the more foreign concepts like pipes, buffering, file locking, and running external commands; students can look these up if they ever need them.
<p>
What I <i>really</i> wish I could do is sit down with my new classes for a week and teach them basic programming and computer science concepts, <a href="http://www.csunplugged.com/">preferably without computers getting involved at all</a>.
