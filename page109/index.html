                <B>Rabbit</b><BR>
We've decided that a good name for our rabbit/lawn-mower is
<I>Shadow</i>, as he actively avoids sunlight.  As a black
rabbit, this makes a lot of sense from a staying
cool/avoiding detection standpoint.
<P>
I'm considering investing in a water-pistol of some sort to
give the local cats a bit of extra encouragement not to
visit.  I've always chased them from the yard as a matter of
course, but now that we have Shadow I need to be
particularly alert.  It's a shame we can't let him roam
unsupervised.
<P>
<B>Jenni</b><BR>
<a href="/person/jenni/">jenni</a> doesn't seem to be updating her diary
at all, so I'll take this moment to do so for her...
<P>
<I>Purchased a house the other day, big three bedroom thing
with gold-embossed walls, marble statues, and landscaped
gardens.  It's much better than PJF's house (which I still
haven't seen yet), although I did have to pay a little extra
for it.  Talking of PJF, now that I have a house and am
feeling so rich I'll have to buy him lunch again.</i>

                <B>Lawn-mower</b><BR>
After much talk of how long the lawn is getting, and after
much prodding from Jacinta, I finally went out and bought
myself a lawn-mower.  It's low-maintance, self-cleaning,
mulches as well as mows, and instead of producing grass
clippings turns them into a high-grade plant fertilizer.  It
can be operated with minimal supervision, has big ears, and
a cute fluffy tail.  We got one in the stylish colour of
black, and I've affectionately called it rabbit.  Except for
one small incident where its bladder control on the doona
left something to be desired, we've been very happy.
<P>
Rabbit's favourite food is grass, favourite game is
go-to-sleep-behind-the-cannas (where it's almost impossible
to retrieve), and has made it quite clear to us that
shredded newspaper is for its litter tray, and most
certainly <I>not</i> a bedding material.  Rabbit likes to
chew on bits of pruned plum-tree.
<P>
I'm trusting Rabbit not to try and take a bite out of my
network connection as I lie under my plum tree and work.
<P>
<B>Ex-work</b><BR>
It would appear that JS, CEO of my previous workplace, has
resigned.  Interesting news.
<P>
<B>Poker</b><BR>
Jacinta and I ran a poker night last week which was quite
successful, and we're doing a similar thing tonight. 
Currently our friends are still a little hesitant to be
playing for money, but I'm sure that we'll be able to
overcome most of them soon.

Oh my goodness.  It was just too easy.  By far the hardest
part of the entire operation was getting syslinux running,
in order to get around a BIOS bug in the firewall box which
stopped it booting from the hard-drive.

                Okay, it's been a while since I've written.  Sorry about
that.  Here's a catch-up on what's been happening.
<P>
<B>Mojotoad Visits</b><BR>
Jacinta and I met with with <a href="/person/mojotoad/">mojotoad</a> the
other day, who's doing his world-victory-lap after being
published in <A HREF="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl
Journal</a> along with yours truly.  We had a few pints and
went out for Indian.  Talked about everything from computers
and geek stuff to biblical fruit and erosion of privacy.  A
very enjoyable evening.
<P>
<B>New T-shirt</b><BR>
I now have a new SourceForge T-shirt that arrived the other
day.  Giving feedback can be worthwhile sometimes. :)
<P>
<B>Consluting</b><BR>
The work that I have been doing has started to dry up a
little, and my next project is due to start "any day now". 
It's been starting any day now for a few months, so I'm not
holding my breath on the timelines.  I'm very certain it
will happen because they've sunk so much work into it, I
just need the green light.  (Actually, I'm thinking of
starting work now and getting to the milestones a little
early.)
<P>
Been also calculating how much full-time work I'd need to do
at modest consulting rates in order to support myself for a
year.  If I wanted to take a bog-standard contract I could
live most comfortably working five months each year.  Whilst
working for five months at once is unattractive, the thought
of a seven month holiday without the thought of work is most
attractive indeed.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Been looking at getting some repairs done to the house.  The
gutters need replacing before autumn/winter begins to rain
in earnest.   Having spoken to one particular builder about
how he can bring in approximately $AU450,000 tax-free in a
good year, I'm considering changing industries. :)
<P>
<B>Computer Security</b><BR>
One of my old old servers which I should have finished
decommissioning ages ago got cracked.  Still investigating,
but it looks like the other machines on my network are
unaffected.  I'm currently in the process of doing clean-up
and locking-down.  The machine in question that was
compromised is now removed from the network and will almost
certainly go into the spare parts cupboard.  The moral of
the story is (a) Don't get lazy because the O/S makes it a
pain in the arse to upgrade packages, and (b) Don't use an
O/S that makes it a pain in the arse to upgrade packages,
because you will get lazy.
<P>
Hooray for apt-get.  :)

Well, I'm certainly not short for work.  That's good, I
think...
<P>
<B>Bandwidth</b><BR>
Flakey network links are so annoying.  Bad network links. 
Bad.
<P>
<B>Games</b><BR>
After watching <a href="/person/kevinl/">kevinl</a> and Susan playing a
certain multi-player game, I went and purchased a copy for
myself.  It's heaps of fun, so I'm not surprised that people
get addicted to it.
<P>
<B>Schnet</b><BR>
Visited Schnet last Friday for Kat's birthday. Kat looked
extremely happy, which is great.  Never got my coffee off
Nate, but I know he's a busy elf.  Played lots of hacky-sack
and drank plenty of brewskis at the pub.
<P>
Had Kevin cycle in on Friday for a meeting in the city.  He
looked as if he loved it, so I'm certain he'll be cycling
even longer distances soon.  ;)
<p>
<B>Girlfriend</b><BR>
Jacinta mentioned that I never write about her in my diary. 
Hi Jacinta!
<P>
<B>Buffy</b><BR>
Buffy (and her moping wuss ex-boyfriend of a vampire Angel)
are back on TV.  Yay.
