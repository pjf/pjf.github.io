This evening I was talking to a homeless woman on the bus about gender
politics. For a long time she had thought she wanted to be a boy, because she
didn't want to be meek and subservient, and she viewed herself as strong and
possessing leadership. But after spending time with men she decided she didn't
want that either, as she didn't want to be hard and uncaring. She wanted to be
a *person*, where actions and words count more than what's between your legs.

We lamented that traditional gender roles don't let us be *people*, they push
us into moulds, and those moulds leave us bereft of essential skills. We have
men who don't know how to ask for support, and women who don't know how to
stand up for themselves. Only teaching people a full compliment of skills, not
oriented by gender, do we end up with *better people*, ones who are able to
better function in the world, and in turn make the world a better place.
 
This by itself was a pretty good conversation, but what really warmed my heart
was that Shannon (that was her name) was positively oozing with joy, despite
having a *very* rough life. "I have more dead friends than alive friends," she
informed me. Of the friends she had left, very few of them were good
influences. And yet she was delighted with her current circumstances.

The reason was simple; Shannon was in love, and after years of being in
a violent, abusive relationship, she was in a *really* good place right now.
She'd found a new partner, one who also had a rough background, but together
they were totally kicking ass. It was very obvious that Shannon understood the
human condition *very* well. Both she and her partner were their own people,
but they cared about each other deeply; they were together because they
*wanted* to be together, not because circumstances forced it, or because it was
simply convenient, or because one felt they would be worse off without the
other. Yes, they had their share of difficulties, like everyone does, but not
only did they make up after them, but they also *communicated*  with each other
to figure out what had happened, and how they could become better people to
improve things for the future. They both had their own dreams, but they were
supportive of each other's. And best of all, they were both compassionate, yet
strong; they both had leadership, and understanding. 

They were people, who *wanted* to be people.

And I personally, think they're going to be kicking quite a lot of ass.
