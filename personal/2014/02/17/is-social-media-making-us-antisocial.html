        <p>I’ve noticed a concerning trend over the last few years, and I’m not
exactly sure what to do about it. As a culture, our communication
habits are changing, and the results may be terrible for our mental
health.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is a long post, and it’s going to help if we start with a brief
review of communication over the ages, beginning with face-to-face
interactions. These provide plenty of <em>non-verbal</em> signals, such as
body language and vocal tone. It’s often clear when interacting with
someone if they’re paying attention or distracted; if they’re angry,
joking, happy, or just bored. (Although even face-to-face, we’re
still good at <a href="http://not-a-jerk.blogspot.com/2012/03/fighting-for-no-reasonhow-were-hard.html" title="Fighting for no reason, how we're hard-hired to be hostile">getting things wrong</a>).</p>

<p>At some point we learned how to read and write, and while letters were
an important stage in our development, I’m restricting myself to looking
at direct and instantaneous communication in this article.</p>

<p>Skip forward a few thousand years to the telephone. This technology
was game-changing. It allowed people to talk, even when separated by
distance. While it wasn’t possible to read body language over the
telephone, one could still read vocal tone. Telephones were a
fixture in people’s homes, so you generally knew you had someone’s full
attention when you were talking to them, and it became rapidly
apparent when you did not.</p>

<p>With the advent of computers, things became more interesting, and definitely
more diverse. were find ourselves with IRC, chatrooms, SMS, instant messenger,
and a variety of other text-based communication forms.  These provided fewer
non-verbal signals (emoticons are a notable exception here), along with less
clues for when someone was distracted with other things or not. But still, one
used these forms of communication to maintain a conversation with an individual,
or a directed group of people.</p>

<div class="pullquote"> <p> <i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-2x pull-left"> </i> The dominant mode of communication with social media is 'post-and-hope'.  </p> </div>

<p>But now we’re seeing a form of communication which is radically
different from what we’ve experienced in the past: social media.
The dominant mode of communication with social media is the
<em>undirected broadcast</em>, what I call “post-and-hope”. You post on your
wall, or tweet to the world, and people may respond, or they may
not. When they do respond, the responses are more ephemeral. It’s
harder to have a personal conversation when all six-hundred of your
friends are watching it, or you’re limited to 140 characters.</p>

<p>Social media doesn’t preclude more directed conversations,
but it is shifting the ways in which we’re communicating. Combined
with the rapid uptake of mobile electronics, where a friend
being ‘online’ may simply mean they’ve opened their phone for a few
seconds in an elevator, there’s even more uncertainty associated with
directed conversations than ever before.</p>

<p>The result is that for many people, a significant amount of communication
is broadcasted, rather than directed, and the continuity of a conversation
is more unpredictable, and more likely to evaporate without a clear verbal
or textual signal (such as “catch you later”), than ever before.</p>

<figure class="right"><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/personal/depression-instant-messaging.png"><img src="/images/personal/depression-instant-messaging.png" /></a><figcaption>For adolescents who perceive themselves to have low friendship quality (the top line), instant messaging is significantly protective to mental health¹.</figcaption></figure>

<p>I’m aware that “all this technology is making us antisocial”
is hardly a new sentiment. My parents expressed concern about me
hanging out on bulletin boards with ‘electronic people’ as a teenager,
even though I viewed that as exceptionally good for my social and intellectual
development.</p>

<p>While the scientific literature shows that spending time on instant
messenger is <em>protective</em> of mental health if one is feeling socially
isolated¹, studies into social media itself seem to be less clear,
and I’m still trying to make sense of them. I’ve included references
at the bottom of the article, in case you wish to do some reading
yourself.</p>

<p>However this is a personal post, and one thing I’m concerned about is
the trends in my own social habits. I communicate with many more people
than I used to, but I’m much less close to any of them.</p>

<div class="pullquote"> <p> <i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-2x pull-left"> </i> I communicate with many more people, but I'm less close to any of them.  </p> </div>

<p>Go back five years ago, and I have a small number of close friends
whom I felt very comfortable talking to, and we would share our
experiences and thoughts extensively. While we weren’t in constant
contact, it was very reassuring to know they existed, and I took
for granted that if I was worried or anxious, or wanted to share
news of a success or receive guidance on some defeat, that I’d have
close friends to fall back on.</p>

<p>Now, things feel different. My close friends are still my friends,
but communicate with them less. When I do communicate,
the conversations are more shallow. I’ve noticed that’s often
<em>my</em> fault; I’m less likely to have an on-line conversation as a
dedicated activity, and they seem to more often start as side-effects from
other social media use, and dry up just as quickly.</p>

<figure class="right"><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/images/personal/support-and-depression.png"><img src="/images/personal/support-and-depression.png" /></a><figcaption>Social support is protective against depression²</figcaption></figure>

<p>That worries me, not just from a social standpoint, but also
from a mental health one. We know that having a
confidant—someone with whom one feels they can talk to about
anything—is hugely protective to one’s mental health. If social media
<em>is</em> making us less close, then we run the risk of many more
people suffering from mental health issues due to that isolation.</p>

<p>I’m sure part of the reason for these changes is the sheer number
of people with whom I interact with on-line. If you were to go back
a decade ago, I had <em>dozens</em> of people in my instant messenger contact
list. Today, my Facebook friends number in the <em>hundreds</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t yet have enough evidence to say that this is becoming an
issue for society in general, but I’m concerned that it might be.
There’s a number of studies showing links between social media
usage and depression, but these don’t show <em>causality</em>; people
feeling isolated may be using social media more as a means of
support. That’s certainly something I’ve done in the past.</p>

<p>What’s just as concerning for me—if not more so—is that that systems like
Facebook are increasingly taking the choice of which stories to display on one’s
feed out of the user’s control, and are instead selecting what they
feel will provide you with the best ‘personalized feed’. That’s generally
understood to be whatever causes you to continue to interact with Facebook,
since that means you’ll view the most ads. However it opens the possibly of
<em>algorithmic isolation</em>, simply because your important posts may not be shown to
others.</p>

<p>Facebook is particularly notable for burying posts where the author
expresses that they’re sad or unhappy. That’s not a deliberate decision on
Facebook’s behalf, but nobody ‘likes’ their friend being unhappy, and many
people don’t know what to say in the comments. To Facebook, a sad post
looks like a boring post, because nobody’s interacting with it. I’ve found
that adding “Likes=Hugs” to the top of my writing is sometimes enough to
overcome this, but it’s rare that a post about one feeling sad can compete
with a picture of a cat.</p>

<p>Still, it seems that every new form of communication is heralded as
being bad for our mental health soon after it’s introduced, and
often those fears end up being unfounded. Social media and its
associated modes of communication are still very young, and while
they’re an active topic of study, it may still be some time until we
truly understand their impact on society and individuals.</p>
