                <B>Dinner</b><BR>
Went to dinner with my parents last night at a nearby
Turkish resturant.  I've been to this resturant many times
before and enjoyed both their food and service, but last
thing things were oddly different.
<P>
Upon entering the resturant, a bearded man, in his 40s or
50s, approached me.  "<I>Excuse me, but are you Mozart?</i>"
he queried with a rich European accent.  The man took it
well when I confessed that I was not Mozart, and he went
back to ordering from the take-away bar.  It never occured
to me before that I may look like a great composer, although
my uncle has been asked many times if he was John Lennon.
<P>
My parents, Jacinta, and myself sat at a table in the
corner.  We talked a little about the menu when I heard
someone calling my name.  "<I>Excuse me?  Paul?</i>"  An old
collegue of mine from my Computer Science days was sitting
on the table next to me.  "<I>Didn't you just submit a
couple of patches to GnuCash?</i>"  Oh dear, my toying with
accounting programs is starting to have influences on the
real world.  Should I be worried?

                <B>General thoughts</b><BR>
I fear that my recent illness and interest in financial
material is not from natural causes, and may be related to
my recent abduction.
<P>
At first I thought the distorted sound, bright lights,
ghostly voices, and the distinct impression of an anal probe
were merely the side effects of eating extra-hot curry after
a few too many beers.  After some careful reflection I feel
that I cannot dismiss this incident out-of-hand, no matter
how normal and trivial it may seem to be.
<P>
My only vivid memories were that of <I>things</i> that were
humanoid in shape.  I distinctly remember one of them having
a beard, but did not catch sight of the rest of its face. 
They were wearing white lab-coats, did not speak, and
appeared to be drinking instant coffee.  I remember trying
-- without success -- to convince one of these creatures
that the ground coffee was much better, even if it took
longer to brew.
<P>
My next memory is that of waking the next morning with a
blocked nose and a strange desire to read <I>TaxPack
98-99</i>.  I suspect that I may be suffering from the
effects of mind-control, mood-altering drugs, or even DNA
manipulation transmitted through a virus vector.
<P>
The virus-vectored genetic manipulation scenario is
unlikely, but must not be ignored.  While I believe that I
am no longer contagious, I may have unwittingly affected
others with my illness.  This could prove disasterous, and
could cost the <A HREF=http://www.ato.gov.au>Australian
Taxation Office</a> hundreds of dollars in claims that
replacement nerf-darts and mini-pumpkins are work related
expenses.
<P>
I am investing in an <A
HREF=http://members.tripod.com/~zoam/afdb.html>Aluminium
Foil Deflector Beanie</a> to guard against mind-control, and
sipping lemon-and-honey to combat the mood-altering drugs
and sore throat.
<P>
<B>Work/GnuCash/Quote.pm</b><BR>
Nothing to report as my illness is adversely altering my
mental capacity to write code.  Will be spending the day in
bed.  <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer>Dancer</a> was
kind enough to send me a get-well e-mail.  I'm glad to see
that my workmates care about my health and continued
well-being.

I still have a snuffly nose which I hope will be better in
the morning.  I'd hate for me to miss our regular Sunday
rockclimbing and mexican feast due to some silly sickness.
<P>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Spent a good part of the evening confessing to GnuCash all
my dark financial secrets.  I now know how much I own (a
bit), how much I owe (a bit), and how much that all works
out to be (a little bit).  For some reason this makes me
feel good, as I didn't really know all this before.
<P>
<B>Hardware</b><BR>
My webserver is emitting a funny `burning-plastic' kind of
smell, possibly because it's been covered with programming
references, newspapers, and old financial statements.  I've
unearthed the webserver to give it a bit more room to
breathe.  Since my nose is blocked I can't really mind the
smell.

                <B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
It didn't happen for me.  My cold stuck with me over night,
and the infection gave me precious little sleep.  Jacinta
was nice enough to make a trip to the chemist this morning
for some cold and flu medication.  I'm feeling okay now, but
I'm well aware of the codine that's blocking the pain.
<P>
I was very much looking forward to rockclimbing, as I
haven't been in a while.  Ian starts at <A
HREF=http://www.schools.net.au>SchoolsNet</a> next week, so
I should be able to drag him to the <A
HREF=http://www.vicranges.com.au>VicRanges</a> a couple of
nights to make up.
<P>
<B>GnuCash/Quote.pm</b><BR>
My finances have never been better documented, and I now
feel I have a better understanding of why accountants seem
so very sad when money goes missing without reason.
<P>
Have added OO-methods into Quote.pm to provide a nicer
interface.  I've also made an effort to tidy up the
documentation, although there's still a bit of work to go. 
I've applied for space on <A
HREF=http://www.sourceforge.net>SourceForge</a> to develop
the project and keep track of its bugs and foibles.
<P>
<B>Geek Musings</b><BR>
Last night Jacinta asked me if I could remember the first
time I had heard Shakespeare.  After a moment's reflection I
realised that I could indeed remember.  The quote was `To
be, or
not to be...' (the whole passage), and I was young enough to
be in primary school.
<P>
What makes the experience peculiar is that the quote was
read to
me by a voice synthesizer called SAM for the Commodore-64. 
SAM bolstered the C-64 BASIC command set with a function
called SAY, that took a phonetic string and spoke it.  SAM
did a surprisingly good job, and I ended up memorising the
entire passage from having the SAM repeat it to me many
times.
<P>
It dawned upon me that I've been a geek for a very long
time, much longer than I would have normally thought.  I
remember at least two English assignments that I completed
by writing code.  Once I wrote a driver for my C-64 printer
to allow it to print Dwarven runes from J.R.R. Tolkein's
<I>Lord of the Rings</i>.  The second instance I did a rough
port of a space-faring board-game (the name of which now
escapes me) for my `Communications Project'.
<P>
By my estimations I've been a geek since I was eight years
old, when I was given my first computer and actively
participated in a role-playing club I helped start at
Primary School.  I'm glad we had such a forward-thinking
principal back at Williamstown North -- he thought grade
three kids playing Dungeons and Dragons was superb, and made
sure we had a place at lunchtimes to run the games.  This
was at a time when current affairs shows were trying to show
links between RPGs and suicides.

Awoke with a snuffly nose which lasted all day, so I didn't
really feel like cycling all over Melbourne looking at
houses.  Despite this I did find a house with some potential
and in a good area.  Interestingly enough the house was
previously tennanted by some friends of Jacinta's.  This
could make a housewarming interesting.
<P>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
After many package installs I have GnuCash running at home. 
The latest CVS trees seem to have a problem with configure
if no --prefix= is set, but otherwise is working fine.  I've
started using GnuCash to track my finances.
<P>
I've never thought that accountants could possibly lead
interesting lives, but for some reason I've got a strange
urge to learn more about the art.  It must be a symptom of
the flu I've picked up.
<P>
Talking of accountants, my ex-landlord still hasn't called
back regarding where we're going to have dinner.  I'll have
to give him another call.
