            <B>It's not just a house, it's an adventure</b><BR>
Got the keys to the house on Monday.  It rained all day,
which made me less enthusiastic about the whole deal of
cycling over to the real-estate agent and the house, but I
finally bit the bullet when I realised that the rain was
just not going to stop.
<P>
Yup, the house was still there and much as we left it. 
Spent about 90 minutes in the sogging rain doing things in
the garden, and decided that it was getting a bit dark and
started to head home.
<P>
Being wet and dark, and the roads a bit slippery, I decided
to take the Merri Creek trail -- a very scenic and relaxing
ride.  Lots of signs up saying "WARNING - Path subject to
flooding", but no actual signs of flood.  Sure, the water
was high, but it wasn't covering the path.
<P>
Nearing St Georges Road, which I would cut through to get
home, I passed a cyclist coming the other way.  She asked if
the path ahead of flooded.  I told her that no, it was fine,
and we went our seperate ways.  Once I got around the
corner, I realised that she was telling <I>me</i> that the
path was flooded, as the creek had broken its banks and
completely covered the path.
<P>
"Doesn't look very deep," I think to myself as I cycle into
the water.  Sure enough, it's only a couple of inches,
although it seems to go on for a long way.  "I'm surprised
that ducks can swim in water this shallow," I think to
myself just before I hit the dip in the path and find the
water level above the top of my wheels.
<P>
I had ducks swimming on either side of me as I continued to
cycle, with most of my bicycle underwater.  The ducks didn't
quite know what to think of me.  :)
<P>
The rest of the trip home went without mishap, although my
bike now has a "high water mark" which makes it quite
obvious how deeply it was underwater.
<P>
Haven't seen much rain today, so if all goes well I'll check
on the house tonight to make sure it's still standing.  Our
first few things (mainly gardening equipment) will be moved
this weekend.

            <B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Minor embarrasment as I discovered that I had to approve my
own posts to the finance-quote-news list.  The company I
work for changing its name as also meant that some of my own
mailing lists no longer recognise me.  Oops.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Settlement is taking place right this very moment, and I
hope to pick up the keys in the next hour or so.  I was
hoping to lie in the sun at the new house, read a book, plan
the garden a bit, and plant some seeds so we'll have
something cropping for when we move in.  If I felt energetic
enough I was also planning on getting some materials to
build the chicken coop/run.
<P>
Unfortunately, after a beautiful weekend, today's turned out
to be very wet and rainy.  It was raining when I woke up at
8am this morning (yay for sleeping in), and it's still
raining now 5 hours later.  No sign of it stopping, either. 
As such, I think I'll have a very wet ride to pick up the
keys, and then spend time wishing I could lie in the sun and
read a book.
<P>
Over the next month we'll be moving things across to the new
house.  Passionfruit vines, rhubarb plants, many pots of
sunroot, seeds and tools, an avagato^W avacado tree and
eventually even furniture.  I've got enough friends and
family wanting to see the new place that I should be able to
get most of the fiddly things over before the big move. 
Somehow I don't think most removalists have much experience
with transporting an 18-month old passionfruit vine.  (Mind
you, neither do I.)
<P>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
The council is sending me out a big set of local regulations
regarding the keeping of chooks.  Interestingly enough, the
maximum allowed without a permit is five, but I already
have six people expecting to have chickens named after them.
<P>
I guess I'll worry more about this as I get more chickens.
To start with I'm planning on getting two bantam australorp
hens, both named "Ian".

Released 1.03 (mainly bugfixes) via CPAN.  It appears that
sourceforge is having a few technical difficulties so I
haven't yet placed the files in their usual home.  Hopefully
sourceforge will be feeling better tomorrow.

Settlement on Monday.  Yay!

It appears that <a href="/person/mojotoad/">mojotoad</a> has also written
an article for the same issue.  Very much looking forward to
reading this.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Really getting sick of all the stuff going on beforehand.  I
suspect the first home insurance company who asks me to sign
something will get my home insurance for the first year. 
There should be a loan contract for me to sign on Monday
(provided that all goes well), and we're doing a final
inspection this weekend to make sure that everything is
still there.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Acting very much as a catalyst right now -- helping lots of
other people work efficiently but not getting as much done
myself as I would like.  This is not unusual for me, I seem
to have had a hand in just about everything and so I'm a
good generic person to go to when questions arise.
<P>
Apparently I'm working on a 9-day fortnight, but I'm still
waiting to see this in writing.  I'm still taking the days
off.  There's been a bit of poor communication (some of it
certainly mine) about the changes to my role, and I'll be
much happier once these get cleared up.
<P>
<B>Open-Source</b><BR>
Ha!  Surely I jest.  Unfortunately been too busy to go near
any sort of open-source development, and when I haven't been
too busy all I've wanted to do is anything but programming.
<P>
<B><a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a></b><BR>
Glad to see that <a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a> is surviving the
USA without too many problems.  I'm missing D's irony and
sarcasm, though.

Looks like Jon is very happy with the article, and it's
currently on the printing presses now.   I've also got
permission to print the article on the <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/">Finance::Quote
webpage</a>.
<P>
I'm sure that my Mom will be absolutely thrilled when I show
her the magazine.  :)
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Settlement in two weeks time.  The big stash of documents I
sent to the loan company seems to have dissapeared (they're
blaming it on the olympics), so I get the fun task of
cycling over to their Melbourne office today to drop the
documents off in person.
<P>
I haven't really even thought of home insurance yet.  I'm
hoping someone will throw a freebie at me for a few months
(not too unlikely).
<P>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
Moving into the new house also means that I can keep
chickens, which I've decided to name after my friends (Ian,
Sofie, Ben, Tara, Daniel and Sarina).  This was going to be
a fairly simple operation, but the namesakes appear to have
become quite insistant as to which chicken breeds I purchase
and name after them.  Ben wants a Golden Silkie, Sofie
something cute (probably a Pekin), Sarina a Japanese
Bantam,  Daniel a Polish and Tara a Frizzle.  Ian's probably
been the best about this and just said he wanted a "brown
chook".
<P>
<B>Bike</b><BR>
Discovered why biscuit kept getting a flat back tyre.  I
found a large bulge that was only really visible when
inflated to riding pressures.  Replaced the tyre and all
seems much better.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
I now have the position of Software Architect in the stats
team.  Fun fun fun.
