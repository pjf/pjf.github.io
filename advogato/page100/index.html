            <B><A HREF="http://www.tpj.com/">TPJ</a></b><BR>
Looks like Jon is very happy with the article, and it's
currently on the printing presses now.   I've also got
permission to print the article on the <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/">Finance::Quote
webpage</a>.
<P>
I'm sure that my Mom will be absolutely thrilled when I show
her the magazine.  :)
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Settlement in two weeks time.  The big stash of documents I
sent to the loan company seems to have dissapeared (they're
blaming it on the olympics), so I get the fun task of
cycling over to their Melbourne office today to drop the
documents off in person.
<P>
I haven't really even thought of home insurance yet.  I'm
hoping someone will throw a freebie at me for a few months
(not too unlikely).
<P>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
Moving into the new house also means that I can keep
chickens, which I've decided to name after my friends (Ian,
Sofie, Ben, Tara, Daniel and Sarina).  This was going to be
a fairly simple operation, but the namesakes appear to have
become quite insistant as to which chicken breeds I purchase
and name after them.  Ben wants a Golden Silkie, Sofie
something cute (probably a Pekin), Sarina a Japanese
Bantam,  Daniel a Polish and Tara a Frizzle.  Ian's probably
been the best about this and just said he wanted a "brown
chook".
<P>
<B>Bike</b><BR>
Discovered why biscuit kept getting a flat back tyre.  I
found a large bulge that was only really visible when
inflated to riding pressures.  Replaced the tyre and all
seems much better.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
I now have the position of Software Architect in the stats
team.  Fun fun fun.

House papers are signed and the deposit is in.  Now we're
just letting the banks fight over who we take our loan
with.  Also have to find insurance, which I had forgotten
about.

            <B>House</b><BR>
Looks like we've finally found a house that the vendor is
willing to sign.  We've had a verbal agreement regarding the
property in East Coburg, and will be signing the contract
tomorrow morning.  I'm currently trying to convince a bank
that application fees are a stupid idea.
<P>
<B>Health</b><BR>
Haven't been feeling too good these last few days.  There's
been a nasty that's been floating around work -- starts as a
sore throat, hibernates for a while, and then blossoms from
there.  It's well blossomed with me right now.  As long as I
don't move away from the eucalyptus burner I don't feel too
bad.
<P>
<B><a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a></b><BR>
Today was <a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a>'s last day at Schnet. 
Dragged myself in to cross-pollinate diseases, wish him
well, and give him a big hug.  I'm going to miss the old
raindeer, especially his beautiful sarcasm. 
<a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a> is actually quite a warm, caring
individual who will be sorely missed.  I wish him all the
very best of luck in the future.

Version 1.02 is released and available for download.  I'm
very pleased to say that the number of information sources
is steadily rising.  Volker Stuerzl and Keith Refson both
have modules that are being released in this version.  Good
work and congratulations to both!
<P>
The server at Sourceforge that hosts the F::Q webpage seems
to be rejecting ssh connections.  That makes it rather
tricky to update the webpages.  :/

            <B>Scratching Itches</b><BR>
The POP server at work has broken, and has made my mail
inaccessible with it.  Even though it's the weekend, I've
diagnosed the problem and am seriously considering ringing
up Ian (or some other nice systems person) to tell them to
install an emergency patch so that I can read my mail using
mutt again.
