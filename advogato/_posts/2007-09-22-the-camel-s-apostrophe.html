<p><b>The camel's apostrophe</b><br />
Jacinta and I have been looking at holiday options recently,
including potentially a camel safari in outback Australia. 
As part of our research, we discovered that greengrocers
aren't the only ones who think that an apostrophe is to mark
the impeding arrival of the letter 's'.  One website
featured the following text:

<p> <blockquote><ul>
<li>Booking's of three or more people for all safaris.
<li>Safaris may be cancelled due to unsuitable weather
condition's.
<li>Safari time's may vary in summer months.
<li>Please state any special food requirement's.
<li>Price's subject to change.
</ul></blockquote>
<p>A suitable reference to <a

Guide to the Apostrophe</a> has been appropriately
dispatched to their webmaster.
