        <B>Travel</b><BR>
I'm writing this entry from my hotel room in Sydney, using a
wireless keyboard so I can type in a relaxed position, and
using a TV set as my monitor.  Yes, I'm interstate again,
for what I believe is the third time (and fifth course!)
in five weeks.
<p>
For some reason we're very popular up here in Sydney, much
more so than in Melbourne.  I don't know if that's because
Sydney doesn't have enough Perl people, so everyone's eager
to learn the language, or if it's because there are
plenty and the local <a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney.PM</a>
are doing a good job and spreading the word.
<p>
This visit I'm teaching members of one of Australia's larger
banks, and they've been a real pleasure to teach.  Almost all
of them have a good amount of development experience already,
so they've been asking questions and absorbing material well.
It's very pleasing.  The feedback forms are also very pleasing.
<p>
On the matter of feedback forms, I find it both ironic and amusing
that the most commonly suggested way to improve the first module
we teach is to make a two-day course, as that's exactly what
we've done.  This particular client, however, requested that the
more intense single-day version be run, as everyone was quite
experienced and would be able to cope.  Indeed, they have coped,
or at least they have so far.  Hopefully they won't blow any
synpases after tomorrow's training as well.
<p>
<B>Travel Surprise</b><BR>
Getting up to Sydney had its own little surprise.  The flight
I was catching left from the international terminal in Melbourne,
despite being domestic for it's first leg up to Sydney.
Flights leaving from the International terminal require a great
deal more time to catch than a regular domestic flight -- even
though you're only going to be on the plane for an hour, you
still need to run the gamut through customs and about 6km
worth of duty free shopping that you can't take advantage of.
<p>
As fate would have it, I arrived "on time" for my domestic flight,
at the domestic terminal, which is after the gates close for
"international" flights.  So, I was in Melbourne, without a
flight, with a course starting the next day that I needed to
teach.  Troublesome, surely.
<p>
Luckily for me, the airlines cover for these situations.  It's
called gouging.  Depending upon how desparate you are, you can
either have your ticket moved to the next available flight in the
same class (usually about 3-4 days time) for only a modest fee
(about 30% of the ticket cost), or they can drop you on the next
flight to Sydney in business class for about 250% on top of what
you paid for your original ticket.
<p>
Of course, everyone else turned up "on time" for their domestic
flight in the domestic terminal as well, so there were about
20-30 people all wanting to get to Sydney, I just happened to
be near the front of the queue, so I was lucky enough to pay
the shockingly high charge to secure one of the six remaining
seats to Sydney that evening.  I really hope the other passengers
weren't in a hurry.
<p>
<B>Thoughts on scalping</b><BR>
For a moment I was surprised that we don't have airline ticket
scalpers.  Almost anyone at the tickets queue at the airport
with a grumpy look on their face and two large suitcases is
almost definitely in a bad spot.  A scalper could easily sell
a ticket for three times its original value and still
undercut the incredible prices charged by the airlines.
<p>
The reason this doesn't happen is the ticket pricing structure.
The tickets most suitable for scalping are non-transferrable,
or transferrable only with 24 hours notice.  The tickets which
can be transferred immediately cost even more than it does to
catch one of those remaining business class seats, and so they're
also a poor investment for the scalper.
<p>
Of course, identification is only checked on baggage checkin,
so potentially a scalper could check-in someone else's baggage,
collect their boarding pass, and then transfer.  This is
definitely a civil offense, and may even be a criminal one since
airlines are involved, both of which are good deterrants to
scalpers trying to make a little cash.  Plus there's the
risk that nobody will want your ticket, and the fact that
you can only reasonable scalp one ticket per day per airline.
<p>
The upside is that a good scalper could accumulate a great many
frequent flyer points.
<p>
<B>AD&amp;D</b><BR>
As Daniel's wedding night wish was for me to run an old 
1st edition AD&amp;D adventure, I've been moving somewhat
towards that goal.  I've filled in a few of my missing books
with electronic copies (a great money-maker for WOTC), and have
been refreshing my knowledge of the rules and adventure.
<p>
The old 1st Ed books by Gary Gygax are great to read, especially
the whole rant on pole-arms at the end of <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>,
or the part of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> which talks
about how swiftly combat can be played out.  The then goes through
an amazing gamut of rules and exceptions, most of which have
been dropped in every game I've played to ensure that combat
<i>does</i> move swiftly.
<p>
Looking through the old books is rather nostalgic and odd.
I started playing AD&amp;D when I was about seven years old,
some 19 years ago now.  Back in those days (and maybe still
today) there was a lot of talk about how AD&amp;D in particular
made you evil, or caused you to go into fits of dangerous
depression.  I still remember being amazed when our primary
school principal sanctioned the use of one of the smaller
schoolrooms for AD&amp;D play during lunchtimes.
<p>
<B>Wedding</b><BR>
Still getting married, and it's still getting closer.  Jacinta's
wedding dress should hopefully reach us next week, but we've
still got a bunch of things to arrange.  I'm going to have to
check around to see what I can do as far as hand-holding for
my clients are concerned while I'm getting married and on
honeymoon.  Somehow I don't think I want to be SSHing from my
palm pilot to fix a misbehaving server while sipping cocktails
on a tropical island.
<p>
<B>House</b><BR>
With the money currently in accounts receivable (due within 30 days),
we will have paid off our home loan.  Not bad considering
we only got the house three years ago, and one of those years
was spent relaxing and earning virtually no money (and definitely
no savings).
<p>
<B>Goodnight</b><BR>
It's reached my bedtime, so I'm going to grab a few hours sleep
before waking early tomorrow, packing my bags, checking out,
opening the lab, teaching for eight hours, and then flying
back to Melbourne in time to sleep and visit a client the
next day.  I sure have a busy life, but it's varied and
interesting, and satisfying if not exhausting at times.
