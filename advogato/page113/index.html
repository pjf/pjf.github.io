                <B>Work</b><BR>
We're in the new building, and it seems that just about
everything got moved across okay.  A lot of people spent a
lot of time over the weekend making sure that things went
smoothly for us today, and I'm very grateful for that.
<P>
There was a small hiccup where my mouse and speakers ended
up in <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.org/person/dancer>Dancer's</a> bin
(the removalists put them there), but otherwise things went
without a hitch.
<P>
The coffee machine isn't plumbed in yet, so we have to use
the back-up machine which isn't anywhere near as good.
<P>
<B>Luke and DataServe</b><BR>
It looks like not only have I met <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.org/person/lukeh>Luke</a> before, I
worked with him.  <A
HREF=http://www.dataserve.org>DataServe</a> was a company
created by Luke and some mutual friends of ours a long time
ago, about when I was 12-13.  Luke even found my old report
(I was head of the Commodore division), where I discussed
some of the software I was working on at the time.
<P>
I'm glad that Luke kept all these documents, they bring back
many memories of when I was a little geek, instead of being
the big geek I am now.  I think that if DataServe were to be
reformed today it would prove to be a quite successful
company -- the people in it have certainly gone on to prove
themselves to be quite talented.
<P>
<B>Homeworld</b><BR>
It's very pretty, has a nice feel, and so far has a
reasonable plot.  Pity I suck at it.   Ian will probably be
dissapointed in me.

<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/lukeh>Lukeh</a> seems
to think that I'm related to some 'important historical
documents'.  I find this flattering, especially considering
that I don't believe I've ever actually met Luke personally,
although I believe almost every other person at Schoolsnet
has.
<P>
I'm looking forward to seeing Luke's documents, I'm quite
curious now.
<P>
<B>A good harvest</b><BR>
Most of my <A
HREF=http://merlin.net.au/~arachne/jerusart.html>Jersualem
Artichokes</a> have died back for the winter, and so I took
the opportunity this weekend to harvest the tubers. I ended
up with a very large bucket filled with roots, and those
which I've tried have been delicious.  I'll definitely be
replanting these next time.

                <B>Geeks with Balls</b><BR>
Went to the Apocalypso ball last night, which is the annual
Infinite Images roleplaying club's ball.  The ball had mixed
goth and hawaiian themes, which was odd but worked.  Managed
to catch up with a lot of old friends who I hadn't seen in a
while, and generally had a very good time.  As it was, the
world didn't end due to the planetary alignments, but we
sacrificed a couple of pineapples anyway.
<P>
The ball was <I>extremely</i> geeky...  I think we would
have been the only ones in the world at the time to be
dancing a conga-line to the great 80's hit "Star Trekkin'".
<P>
<B>Moving hassles</b><BR>
Schoolsnet is currently moving, so I can't access my
e-mail.  <A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/rcp>Ross</a>
tells me that I should go out and get a life for a day.  I
already have a life, I just use e-mail to manage it.

                <B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian was very nice and drove me to a faraway place to get my
television repaired.  I'm glad that I don't drive, peak hour
traffic is awful, parking meters are expensive, and finding
parking spots is hard.  I'm very glad I have my $100 bicycle
which gets me home-to-work in 12 minutes with no pollution,
no expense, no parking hassles, and with a bit of healthy
exercise.  I'm still upset there aren't any more hills
between home and work, because I'm getting flabby with the
short trip.
<P>
Ian's also much become much better at rockclimbing than me,
so I'm incredibly jealous.
<P>
<B>Sofie</b><BR>
Sofie (Ian's partner) is going to come and work for
Schoolsnet in a couple of weeks.  This is good, because
Sofie appreciates good beer, whereas Ian and Benni don't.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Moving tomorrow, so I'm not expecting to get much done. 
Scotty tells me that I haven't been forgotten in bugland,
and that one day the promised land will come.  That's okay,
because I've got a bunch of bugs I'm going to be delegating
anyway.  :)
<P>
<B>Natedawg</b><BR>
Nate's practice at Half-Life is paying off.  He's become
incredibly good at Counter-Strike, probably because he plays
it very single night of the week.  He whipped our arses
hugely today, which was pretty humiliating.  To make things
worse, I'm going to be broken up from my old squad (Dancer
and Ben) as part of the move at work.
<P>
Nate also came climbing with us yesterday.  He looks pretty
spunky in my tight blue shorts.
<P>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
GnuCash is good.  Saved me money again by keeping a good
hold on my finances.  I'm most satisfied.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Benni has joined the Finance::Quote team and has offered to
do fun stuff with the web-page.  Thanks Benni!  (I suspect
the real reason is that he wants to write Advogato diaries
but feels he needs open-source experience to do so.)

Both Schoolsnet games are up and running now, and it's been
lots of fun to watch.  I'm still surprised at how eager
everyone was to join and how quickly the games were started.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Moving to the new building at the end of the week. 
Hopefully we might have air-conditioners there, as I'm
finding the temperature in my office quite a bit high for my
liking.  It also looks like I'll get a beautiful view as
well.
<P>
It looks like I'll be sharing an office with <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/scottp>Scottp</a>, which
will make things interesting.  Not because there's anything
wrong with Scott, but because he's so valuable and in
demand, so I expect there'll be a lot of traffic through the
office.  I've also been known to generate a bit of traffic
with people reporting bugs, CVS issues, and other things.
<P>
Justin shall be posted at the door to try and stem the tide
of people.  He's rehearsing his line now -- "None shall
pass!".
<P>
<B>Gwen</b><BR>
Gwen's been a little angel.  I came home last night and
found that she had washed all the dishes.  Washing dishes is
my most hated chore, so I'm <I>very</i> thankful to Gwen for
this favour.  It looks like we'll be getting along well. 
She even said that she liked my cooking.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Benni calculated how much Ian is paying for his new car on a
"per week" basis.  It's about twice what I pay in rent,
although I don't think he's planning to live in his car.
<P>
Ian's been claiming that the real reason he purchased the
car is that there are better seltbelts for me in the
back-seat.  (When there are five people in Ian's car, I
usually volunteer to sit in the middle at the back, between
any cute girls that might be in the same car.)  While I
think this is very kind of him, I'm surprised that he didn't
just give me $20,000 and keep the change for himself.  I'm
surprised at how generous he is.
