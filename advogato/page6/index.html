                <p><b>Autodie 2.00 released</b><br>
This weekend the long awaited <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie 2.00</a> for
Perl was released to the CPAN, which was almost immediately replaced
by 2.02, which fixes some oopsed tests and which adds a couple more features to
give us a really sweet experience.  This blog entry assumes you're
using 2.02.
<p>
Observant viewers will notice that the major version number has
changed.  I've taken the great leap from 1.999 to 2.00.  Clearly,
something is different, and you might be wondering what.
<p>
Well, autodie 2.0 now supports a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie::hints">hinting
interface</a> for user-defined subroutines.  Put simply, if you have a
user-defined subroutine that does something funny to signify failure,
you can now tell autodie about that.  Once it knows, it can Do The
Right Thing when checking your subroutine.  You can even put the hints
into the same file as those subs, and if someone is using autodie
2.00, it will find the hints and use them.
<p>
This may not sound very exciting, but it is.  It means that a lot of
really ugly error-checking code, both on the CPAN and the DarkPAN, can
go away.  Lexically.  Still not convinced this will change your life?
Let's look a little more closely; trust me, you'll like it.
<p>
Let's pretend you're working on a piece of legacy code.  For some
reason, the people who wrote this code decided the best way to
signal errors is by returning the list <tt>(undef, "Error
message")</tt>.  I don't know why, but I've seen this anti-pattern
emerge independently in <i>three</i> 100k+ line projects I've been
involved in.

        <div class="p-summary">
            
                <p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 3</b><br>
Today I decided to travel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumeirah">Jumeirah</a> beach and surrounds, a decision
I made purely based upon the number of tags and photographs in the
area for <i>Google Earth</i>.  Since I'd be doing this during
the day, I decided to take a practical approach.  I left the laptop
and most electronics back in the hotel, and packed lots of water
and sunscreen.  I wore my most breathable cotton top, a
<i>linux.con f.au</i> hat, and what Jacinta calls my "pirate pants".
These pants are very loose, and very breezy, and very comfortable.
But as a result, I didn't look like a local, and I didn't look like
a typical tourist, either.  I was, however, protected from the sun
and reasonably cool.
<p>
I caught a taxi to Jumeirah mosque, for just a little
over 10 AED (about $3.50).  I didn't expect to find the mosque open
(and indeed, it wasn't), but I got some nice photographs.  The main
reason I wanted to visit the mosque is that it was walking distance to
the beach, and (if you're me) Sheik Zayed Road.  While two days ago I
had discovered that walking around the old souks resulted in someone
trying to sell me a fake rolex every few minutes, today I discovered
that walking around Jumeirah had a taxi beep at me every few minutes,
hoping that I would need a lift somewhere.
<p>
Jumeirah beach is very pretty, and very hot.  There weren't many
people out, and a lifeguard watched lazily from a tower.  The beach
came with lots of rules, one of which was "strictly no cameras", 
so I had to be a little more discreet with my photographs.  The
water looked extremely inviting, and I relished the idea of hopping
in for a swim.  Unfortunately (and accidentally), I had left my
swimming gear back in the hotel, and my mask and snorkel back in
Australia.
<p>
At the beach I got some great photographs of the skyline of Sheik
Zayed Road, especially of the Burj Dubai, which distinctly reminds
me of the Combine Citadel in Half-Life 2.  Having looked around
the beach, I decided to head off toward Sheik Zayed road, which
I was certainly would be filled with marvels.
<p>
The walk was a lot harder than my previous wanderings around Bur
Dubai, even though the distance was shorter.  I was walking
through a residential distract, and as such there was a lot
less cover, and fewer amenitities.  It was clear that Jumeirah
was home to the rich, with magnificent mansions and expensive
cars.
<p>
After about 1.5km of walking from the beach, I was finding that
the heat and exposure was making me a little uncomfortable, and
that while I had packed a lot of water, I'd probably need to
think about looking for more.  Luckily, I had just chanced upon
a park.  It was beautiful, green, lush, and immaculately maintained.
For some reason, the gate was shut, with a large padlock, and it
looked as if this gate had been shut for some time.  Perplexed,
I went to a second gate, and it was also closed.  I noticed a
person in the park, but he appeared to be a groundskeeper, who
was distracted by talking on his mobile phone.  This had me even more
perplexed; why spend water, and money, and high-value property on
creating a park that nobody can get into?  This wasn't marked as a
private park, and it even had a playground in the middle of it.
Maybe it closed during the middle of the day, and re-opened later on?
<p>
A climbing check, and two stealth checks later, I found myself
a section of soft grass and a shady tree under which to snooze.
I woke after about half an hour, a little surprised that the
groundskeeper hadn't woken me.  Refreshed, I continued on my
way, and discovered much to my delight that Dubai has public
<i>refrigerated</i> drinking founains.  With my water bottles
refilled, and my face and arms splashed with blissfully cold
water, I continued onwards.
<p>
The region I was walking through seemed to be filled with
houses that were universally big.  However one house in particular
stood out.  It was on the corner of two streets and was unfinished.
That in itself is nothing special; Dubai seems to be in a constant
state of construction, but it was clear this building had been
unfinished for quite some time.  The shell was made, but that's
all which was there.  Amusingly, a sign on the side said "For Sale
or Rent".
<p>
After walking past another park (also beautiful, closed, and
deserted), I eventually reached Sheik Zayed Road.  This is the
home to many of the tallest buildings in Dubai, and is a spectacular
sight from the air, but amazingly dull on the ground.  These
were hotels, and office blocks, and the odd food outlet here and
there.  It was also completely impossible to cross on foot.  It
<i>looked</i> like some footbridges were under construction, but
they were nowhere near finished, and they were so big I suspect
they were for yet another road link, and not meant for pedestrian
traffic at all.
<p>
I walked down the street, and got some decent photographs.
My plan was to walk across to the Dubai Mall, take a look around,
and then walk up the other side of Sheik Zayed Road to the Emerites
Towers.  As it happened, try as I might, I couldn't find a way
to get across the street, which has twelve lanes, and cars travelling
at considerable speed.
<p>
Hot, disappointed, and tired, I decided to try and find someplace
cool, and preferably with restrooms.  Being Dubai, there was a small
mall not too far away, and I made my way toward it.  It had a
supermarket, and an electronics superstore, and in a rare moment
of impulse purchasing, I grabbed a copy of <i>EA Sports Active</i>
(which apparently sucks less than Wii Fit), after carefully checking
it for any signs that indicated that perhaps it would only work in
certain regions.
<p>
If I had my laptop with me, I would have pulled out my maps and
looked for interesting activities, but since it was not available,
and since I had gone all this way to discover that Sheik Zayed road
sucked, I hailed a taxi to get back to town.  This was one of the
best parts of the day, since the driver was very talkative.  He was
from Pakistan, to which he'd love to return, but apparently there are
no jobs there.  He had worked previously in the Ukraine, and had
moved to Dubai eight months ago.
<p>
My driver commented that Dubai is an artificial city.  It's got
artificial islands, artificial buildings, artificial snow, and
artificial parks.  People are here because Dubai has done an amazing
job of marketing itself to the rich, but due to the global financial
crisis, the rich aren't rich anymore, and they're flying back overseas.
Tourism is down, jobs are more scarce, and so many of the not-so-rich
who have come here for work are also going back overseas.  Apparently
all this was great reducing traffic congestion and getting me back to
my hotel, but it sucked for the city as a whole.
<p>
Back at the hotel I had a bite to eat, and wrote this blog.  My plane
leaves at 9:35am, which means I want to be at the airport at 7:35am,
which means I want to be leaving the hotel at 7am, which means waking
before that.  If I want to avoid too much jet-lag I should be going
to bed <i>now</i>, and waking super-early in the morning.  Instead I'm here posting blog entries, and discovering that the the UAE censors flickr, so there won't be any photographs until I get home.

                <p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 2</b><br>
I'm never going to be awake early in the morning so I can visit the
museum if I keep getting back to my hotel at 12:30am, and blogging about
my day.  And yet that's what I'm doing right now.
<p>
Today was my second day in Dubai, and I discovered that Dubai has
westerners, women, and arabs; they all hang out in the malls.  After
sleeping in again (goodness, I was tired), I decided to go to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mall_of_the_Emirates">Mall of the Emirates</a> (the one with indoor skiing in middle
of the desert), and then make my way by foot to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_al_arab">Burj Al Arab</a>
area, which I estimated was a 2.5 km walk, and hence pretty easy.
<p>
I caught a taxi, as the distance was much too far to walk, and I had no
idea which bus to catch.  I had a great chat with the taxi driver; he was
from Nepal, had moved to Saudi to work (not far from where I was
working), and was now in Dubai.  I asked if he had any family here,
and he laughed.  Apparently Dubai is so expensive, especially with
rent, there's no way he could support a second person; the plan is to
work here as long as he can stand it, and take his savings back home.
<p>
It seems that with the global financial crisis (GFC), while Dubai still has
lots of taxis, it's lacking the tourists who normally use those taxis.
The GFC and the drop in tourism is something I'd heard from a few sources
now, and it's clear that a lot of Dubai depends upon the tourist trade.
<p>
When I stepped into the Mall, it felt like stepping into America.  It
had American shops, American food, and American people.  Actually, as
I was to discover after talking to a few of them; the majority of the
westerners were from the UK.  Almost everything in the mall had prices
similar to what I'd pay back home, and like most malls, most of it
were things I had absolutely no interest in at all.
<p>
Luckily, I found one of my objectives for the day, and that was a free
wireless hotspot.  I eventually found the access point, it's just
outside the cinema, and the SSID is "yournetworkname".  I used it to
call home (again, hurray for VoIP), and after a good chat ran down
my laptop battery.  Unfortunately, I didn't bring my external battery
(it's heavy!), so any remaining communication had to be done via
a hand-held.
<p>
The other discovery I found in the mall was an arabic gift shop, which
was filled with local wares and tourists.  Amazingly, I actually
enjoyed browsing here; this certainly wasn't stuff I'd see in
Australia (or anywhere else), and the prices were extremely
affordable.  There was also a hilarious collection of art-work out the
front of the door.  Words can't do these justice, so you'll just have
to look at the photos (coming soon) and see.
<p>
I purchased a selection of gifts and while often it was easy for me
to say "$x will like this", I discovered that was very hard when
$x = 'jarich'.  Eventually I went for the shotgun approach, and got
her one of everything.
<p>
Somehow, after two calls home, some IM chats with friends, a selection
of gifts, some photographs of the ski slopes, and some chats with the
locals, it had got rather late, so I decided to set out on my walk.
This was made more challenging by the fact that my laptop had a flat
battery, and that's where my maps were located, but since the Burj
Al Arab is the world's tallest building, it's not hard to spot and
walk toward it.
<p>
I should correct myself there, it's not hard to spot.  Walking toward
it <i>was</i> hard, since there were huge multi-lane highways, and
construction work, and no obvious way to actually walk there.  I could
(and in hindsight, <i>should</i>) have got a taxi there.  It would
have cost AED 10 (about $3.50), which would have been a bargain for
the XP I would have gained visiting it and the nearby Souq Madinat.
<p>
As it was, I ended up walking fruitlessly in what was essentially the
wrong direction.  Eventually I stopped for some food outside the
<i>Lulu Hypermarket</i>, where the serving staff of the fast-food
place I frequented were delighted that I was from Australia, and
gave me detailed information about the busses in the area, and were
generally awesome.  They were from the Phillipines, and collectively
were the nicest people I've met all trip.  It's just a shame the food
wasn't.
<p>
Having found the bus (AED 2 rather than AED 45 for a taxi), I looked
forward to being able to see all the huge towers along
<i>Sheikh Zayed Road</i>, which is the home of some of the most
opulent hotels and establishments.  Consequently, I was dreadfully
disappointed when it decided to go down Al Wasl Rd instead, which
doesn't have much sightseeing at all.  Eventually the bus pulled into
the Bur Dubai bus station, which I had never been to before, but which
I knew was walking distance from my hotel.
<p>
Unfortunately for me, I didn't know in which direction my hotel lay,
and due to an inefficient hashing algorithm being used in my brain,
I couldn't recall the name of the street with my hotel, either.
I knew I was staying in the Ramee Apartments, but apparently Ramee
is a chain with a number of Dubai hotels.  Plus, my laptop battery
was dead, so no checking maps for me.
<p>
Luckily for me, I was in Dubai, so I just walked across the road to
the mall (Dubai has plenty), plugged in my laptop, and fired up Google
Earth with all my cached maps.  The bus stop was only 600m from my
hotel as the crow flies.
<p>
On walk to my residence, down a surprisingly deserted street, a man
approached me from an alleyway.  From experience I figured this
probably meant he wants to sell me a <i>100% genuine fake rolex</i>,
although for a moment where I wondered if people get mugged in
these parts, and there was a reason nobody else was walking down this
street.
<p>
"Excuse me, but do you speak French?"  Okay, I <i>really</i> didn't
expect that.  I admitted I didn't, and wondered where this
conversation would go.  "Oh.  Then do you have a hotel?"  I started
to wonder if French-speaking, homeless tourists were common in these
parts.  "Yes, I have a hotel.  I'm walking there now."
"Oh.  Are you sure?  Because if you need a room, I have a room you can
rent.  It's very nice."  "No, really, I do have a hotel."  "Oh, okay,
where are you from?"  "Me?  Australia.  How about you?"  "I'm from
France."
<p>
Suddently, the conversation made sense.  My new acquaintance was over
here working, and with rent prices being so high, he was looking for
a room-mate.  He would have been most happy with someone who could
speak French, but I'd do.  If I was unhappy with my hotel, or sticking
around in Dubai, he'd be happy to split the room costs with me, 50-50.
<p>
We had an interesting chat, and I pointed that I could see my hotel
and was about to turn down one of the streets toward it.  We wished
each other a good night, and I dropped past the 24 hour
<i>Super Happy Mart</i> to replenish some supplies for breakfast.
<p>
Tomorrow I should try to wake up early and visit the museum, but based
on prior experience I'm not sure if I will.  Failing that, my plan is
to catch a bus or taxi to <i>Jumeirah Mosque</i>, check out the beach, and
then walk through the back-streets of Al Bada to Sheikh Zayed Road,
which should put me in the heart of the "down-town district".  I'm sure
I can find myself some trouble from there.  ;)
