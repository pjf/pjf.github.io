                <p><b>Tightening up your Facebook privacy</b><br>
I've previously discussed the <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=598">new Facebook privacy system</a>, what they mean to you, and some recommendations on keeping at least some privacy.  If you haven't read this post, I suggest you do so now, as I won't be repeating those recommendations here.
<p>
Since my last update, I've had a lot of feedback, and done a bit of exploring, and discovered there are some <i>extra</i> privacy controls that are rather hard to find!  One thing that had me perplexed was how to hide which groups I was a member of.  Groups are juicy stuff, they tell me a lot about your beliefs, interests, and social ties.  These are things you may not wish to be broadcasting to the world.  Events are the same, but even more so, since they give me an idea of where you are actually <i>are</i>, and who you're physically interacting with.  You probably want to have some control over who can see these.
<p>
Luckily, you <i>can</i>; the controls just aren't where you expect them to be.  They're not in Privacy Settings at all, they're in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/editapps.php">Application Settings</a>.  By selecting <i>Edit Settings</i> you can change the privacy on your groups, events, gifts, links, notes, and photos; although the photos setting only controls who can see your photos tab/box/link; individual albums have their own privacy controls.
<p>
When deciding on your privacy settings, it's worth keeping two things in mind:

                <p><b>New Facebook Privacy and You</b><br>
Facebook are in the process of changing how their privacy settings
work, and today, I was given the option to migrate my account over
to the new scheme.   These were
<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=190423927130">announced
on the facebook blog</a> about a week ago, and sounded quite promising.
Unfortunately, I actually feel creeped out by the new system.
<p>
I'm going to start with the good thing.  Yes, that's right, there's
only a single <i>good</i> thing about the change that I've found.
When making status updates, one now has fine-grained control over who
sees them.  I can have a status update that's only seen by my family,
or only seen by my friends who like to dress as pirates, or by
everyone except my friends in Sydney.  This is something that a lot
of people have been asking for, and it's great to see it implemented.
<p>
Unfortunately, the rest sucks.
<p>
I've some some <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=590">blogging</a> about Facebook
privacy in the past, as well as a <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=591">conference presentation</a>
and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/pjf/full-frontal-nerdity-facebook-privacy">radio
interview</a>.  In all cases, I've recommended using the (difficult
to find, but incredibly valuable) button marked <i>Do not share any
information about me via the Facebook API</i>.  When ticked, that
would block <i>almost</i> all the information I could gain about a
user with my tools, which try to squeeze as much information from
the Facebook API as possible.  Admittedly, there were some leakages,
but not many.
<p>
That setting is now gone.  <i>All</i> the applications, installed by
<i>all</i> your friends, now have access to your "publicly available
information", and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.
<p>
Publicly available information includes Name, Profile Picture, Gender,
Current City, Networks, Friend List, and Pages.  What's more
disturbing for me is that the new <i>Applications and websites</i>
settings don't provide a control for sharing of events.  In fact,
some of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=145076327240">volunteers
for my privacy study</a> have gone from me not being able to see
<i>anything</i> about them, to me being able to see their past,
current, and future events!  That disturbs me, not least because
<i>I</i> want to control who can see which events I've attended.
<p>
The other thing to dwell on here is <i>pages</i> are now publicly
accessible.  Pages are things that you can <i>fan</i>, such as
companies, or bands, or even <a href="http://www.facebook.com/follow.paul">privacy researchers</a>,
and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/perltips">newsletters</a>.  To be
honest, these were creepy to begin with, because the <i>owner</i>
of a page could access all sorts of bulk demographic data about their
fans, and even export it for processing with other tools.  But
now, the list of pages you've fanned are <i>public</i>.
<p>
Public information in Facebook is available to <i>everyone</i>, even
users who haven't logged in, and third party applications and websites.  That's bad.  You may have
have fanned pages that relate to controversial beliefs or sexual
preferences.  Your probably don't want a potential employer
to be able to see these, but now there's nothing you can do about
this either, except for un-fanning those pages.
<i>I recommend you do this now.</i>
<p>
What's also conspicuously missing are the ability to control is what
goes onto the <i>recent activity</i> section of your Wall.  I'm
looking at one my volunteers now who previously never had their
<i>like events</i> posted to their wall, and it's now covered with
them.  This gives me a wealth of information about who they're
interacting with, which in turn is very useful if I'm planning 
to do any social engineering.
<p>
In fact, it even links to events and posts that my friends like, but <i>that I can't see</i>.
I can even extract Facebook IDs (fbids) of the target posts.
While this doesn't in itself let me access the information directly, I
can certainly tell when two of my friends are liking the same post.
Based upon what I know about my friends, I may be able to infer more
than that, or ask one friend what another friend has just "liked".
<p>
You <i>can</i> manually remove recent activity from your wall, but you
have to do it manually by finding the event you want deleted, and selecting
the 'Remove' option that appears when you hover to the right of it.
Joining groups also results in recent activity (without the option of
turning it off), and there's a chance that other events may appear
there as well.
<p>
In fact, talking of groups, I can't find any privacy
controls for <i>them</i> either.  For some of my friends, they're
visible.  For some of my friends (and apparently for myself), they're
not.  At the very least this is confusing, and it may simply represent different friends being at different stages of the privacy migraation.
Group information gets leaked all over the place anyway (recent events, groups recently joined, <i>and</i> publicly visible group lists), so regardless how this is being controlled, I can probably find
out which groups you're a member of regardless.
<p>
What I find most disturbing of all is that <i>my</i> friends list has gone
from completely private to completely public.  While I've found the
control that allows me to no longer display my friends on my profile,
since they're now "publicly available information", they're still
accessible by other means.  I actually consider my list of friends
to be <i>very</i> private; and I'm not at all happy that's changed.
<p>
Oh, and for those who remember me talking about <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=590">dark stalking</a> to infer the existence of other users who had otherwise completely hidden themselves from view?  Well, it's not that big an issue anymore, since I can now directly navigate to their pages (from their UIDs that I'd found previously), and see their "publicly available information".  Good work in protecting their privacy, Facebook, good work...
<p>
<b>Recommendations</b><br>
So, you might be wondering what I recommend?  Well, to begin with,
make sure that you're happy with your new "publicly accessible
information" <i>really</i> being public.  If you don't want your
grandparent, work colleague, potential employer, stalker, dog, guild,
or whoever else seeing your Name, Profile Picture, Gender, Current
City, Networks, Friends, or Pages, then <i>change or remove them
now</i>.  They're available to <i>everyone</i>, including
unauthenticated users, "facebook-enchanced applications and websites",
and via the API.
<p>
Go to your profile page.  Scroll down until you see
<i>Recent Activity</i>.  Anything you don't want to see there,
delete it now.  Anytime you join a group, or like an event, or
fan a page, or change your relationship status, or sneeze,
go back to Recent Activity and check if you're happy with that
being broadcasted.  
<p>
Go through all the new privacy settings, and think about
each one.  Some of them may not have even been mentioned in the
migration tool.  My date of birth had unexpectedly went from being
completely private to compeltely public.
<p>
Stay informed.  If you want updates from me, then
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=145076327240">join my
privacy study</a> or subscribe to the relevant
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/facebook-privacy">google
group</a>.  Make sure you <a href="http://www.facebook.com/fbsitegovernance">fan the Facebook Site
Governance page</a>, since that's where many updates are posted,
and is a hub for user feedback.
If you want another perspective on the changes, the
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
have also posted <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/facebooks-new-privacy-changes-good-bad-and-ugly">their
analysis</a> of the changes.
<p>
Finally, be aware this is not the first time a major website has changed their privacy policy, and it certainly won't be the last.  If you really want something to remain private, you might want to avoid putting it on-line in the first place.

                <p><b>Perl 5.11.1</b><br>
I've been behind in my blogging; time seems to fly when one is having fun, and I've been having a pretty good time recently.  Most of it's involved working with people and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622533258381/">science</a>, rather than technology.  After I finish my taxes (not yet overdue), this may change.
<p>
In the meantime, I can't go without mentioning that <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=09/10/21/1439243">Perl 5.11.1</a> has been released.  This isn't a stable version of Perl, but it's a point release on the way toward 5.12.0.  I'm quite excited about 5.12.0 for many reasons I'll go into later, but they all involving modernisation of the language.
<p>
Of note in 5.11.1 (and hence 5.12.0) is that deprecation warnings are turned on by default.  This isn't scary; it means that if you've got old code that's going to break in the future, then Perl will start warning you about that well in advance.
<p>
Of other note is a minor point, and that's the ability to include version numbers in package declarations.  One can now write <tt>package Foo::Bar 1.23</tt>, rather than having to do cumbersome things with the <tt>$VERSION</tt> package variable.

I've just spent the week teaching Perl in Sydney.  It was good.  Actually, it was <i>really</i> good.  My class were close in ability, asked intelligent questions, thought through problems, asked for assistance when needed, quizzed me about advanced topics during the breaks, and generally showed themselves to be awesome.

                <p><b>Fun with QR Codes and Perl</b><br>
Short blog today, but cool tech.  I've been playing around with 2D barcodes recently, and have just pushed a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/">Perl Tip</a> on <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2009-10-08.html">generating QR Codes with Perl</a>.  Given how incredibly easy this is, I'm tempted to generate huge numbers of these and go sticking them around town for my own nefarious purposes. ;)
