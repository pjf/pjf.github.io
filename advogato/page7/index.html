                <p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 1</b><br>
<i>I'm posting my adventures out-of-order, apologies for any chronological confusion caused.  The events in this blog post happened yesterday.</i>
<p>
Last night I flew back to Dubai after my stint teaching Perl in
Saudi Arabia.  On the flight one of the Emirates stewards recognised
me from my Australian flight, and we shared a few friendly words.
Another seemed to take a shine to me and somehow produced the best
coffee I've had all week; I suspect they have an espresso machine
hidden away somewhere that they only bring out for special occasions.
As such, even though my flight arrived at 2am, I was awake and happy.
<p>
Dubai airport has free wireless, which is something I am deeply
grateful for.  Using the amazing power of VoIP I called home (where
it was a sensible time), and had a lovely chat with Jacinta.
Amusingly, the call cost me much less than if I were in Australia
making the same call from a mobile.
<p>
Eventually, with my e-mail updated and my social meter refilled,
I caught a taxi to my hotel.  It's a three-star apartment hotel in
the Bur Dubai district, which I had picked because it was cheap,
and looked like it was close to busses, souks, and the museum.  I
arrived, and pretty much collapsed into bed.
<p>
The hotel is right next to a mosque, and I had heard from a few
reviews that one can expect to be woken up with the call to prayer.
Sure enough, a few hours after I had gone to sleep, I could hear
soft, dulcet tones calling the faithful to awake with the first light
and gather for prayer.  I stirred only a little and smiled; the
call was very soft, and very musical, this wouldn't cause me to
lose any sleep at all.  Then the mosque outside my window started
its call to prayer, with the volume cranked to eleven.
<p>
Looks like I'll be waking at first light tomorrow.
<p>
The hotel itself been really good.  Being an apartment-hotel, I have
cooking facilities, the most important for me are a kettle and
microwave.  It also has a washing machine, and I've taken the
opportunity to wash some of my clothes.  My biggest complaint is
that like many hotels, it <i>does</i> have in-room Internet access,
and it costs a fortune.  There also seems to be an expectation that
guests leave their keys at reception when leaving the hotel (maybe
people have lost or disappeared with them?), but since nobody has
taken the time to explain that to me, I've been taking my keys with
me.
<p>
Today I woke reasonably late, enjoyed a long hot shower, and
prepared myself some maps to help me get around.  I'd figured that
on my first day I'd explore the local district (old Dubai), and on
the second day I'd explore further away (new Dubai).  A few people
had mentioned that walking in Dubai in the middle of the day is
unwise, but I like walking, and I like hot weather, so how bad can
it be?
<p>
About 45'C (113'F) and <i>humid</i> is the answer.  I had packed plenty of
water, and stuck to the shade, so I got a few good hours of
walking in before I decided to find a bus-stop for a rest.  Bus-stops
in Dubai are wonderfully civilized, since they're air-conditioned.
Unfortunately mine didn't have wireless access.
<p>
The main problem with trying to see Bur Dubai during the middle of
the day is that everyone else is smart enough to go and do something
else when it's that hot, and so with the exception of lunch venues and
supermarkets, eveything was closed, even the malls!  This was a bit
of a disappointment as I had found the museum, but it was also closed.
I hope to get in early tomorrow.
<p>
While I was in Saudi Arabia, my colleagues there told me that more
foreigners live in Dubai than locals.  I now believe them!  Exploring
Bur Dubai felt more like exploring India.  I too was obviously
something peculiar; I was a westerner, I had long hair, and I was
walking in the middle of the day in Dubai.  Any one of those
attributes was out-of-the-ordinary, so at times I felt that I was
positively head-turning.
<p>
To be honest, I enjoyed the attention.  Most of what I was were
smiles; a few people asked where I was from, and what it was like
in Australia, and why I was walking in the middle of the day when
everyone sensible was out of the sun and having a rest.
<p>
Walking through Bur Dubai took me to the fabric souk, but most of it
was closed.  I'm not much of a clothing/fabrics person, so that didn't
bother me too much.  It also took me to Dubai Creek, which is a
fascinating and enchanting throng of activity.  Water taxis dart
back and forth, larger dhows and other vessels travel up and down,
and somehow nobody collides with anyone else.
<p>
From here I returned to my room and had a snooze, but my evening
walk took me back to the creek.  I took a water taxi across for
the standard fare of 1 dirham (about $0.30), and set out to explore
Deira, the old parts of Dubai north of the creek.
<p>
In Bur Dubai, there were an endless number of shops.  I walked along
"Computer Street" and past "Bank Street" in my travels.  I found
streets that were filled with eateries, and filled with clothing
stores.  In Deira, the streets were also filled with shops, but it
felt like they had been randomly generated.  There's be stores
selling mobile phones, car tyres, bedding, motorcycles, computers,
food, movies, whitegoods, furniture, electronics, beauty products,
and fish, all next to each other.  Many seemed to have equally
random names, my favourite of which was "Moist Flower Electronics".
The streets were twisty-turvy little things, and I soon found myself
lost, and not for the first (nor the last) time that day.
<p>
I don't really mind being lost in other cities.  It means I get to see
things I didn't plan, and in Dubai in particular, I can always hail
a taxi to take me back to my hotel.  So I continued onwards, hoping
to find the Gold Souk that I had marked on my map, but really happy
with anything.
<p>
I eventually found myself at the Hyatt hotel and its attached mall,
because I wanted a break from the heat, and I had discovered my
map of Dubai had lacked public toilets.  Inside the mall was an
ice-skating rink, and while I didn't skate, it sure was nice to
be in a cool environment again.  Most other things were closed, so
after I had made myself more comfortable, I decided to go exploring
again.
<p>
Without too much travel, I found myself at the Dubai fish market,
a place which I was able to discover by its unique scent alone.
In Australia, I'm used to fish markets generally being indoors, and
air-conditioned.  I think the market had one air-conditioned
building, and that was filled with people in the process of preparing
the fish for sale (sorting, gutting, filleting, etc).  Most of the
other stalls had generous amounts of ice to keep the fish cold.
<p>
I honestly can't do the fish market justice with words.  There are
people <i>everywhere</i>.  There are fish, <i>everywhere</i>.  The
quantity of fish and people dwarfed anything I've seen in Australia.
<p>
The most striking image of the market was outside, where a huge line
of sharks were lined up outside; I can only assume for transport,
since nobody seemed to be buying them.  While it appeared that were
once on ice, the ice had since melted, so it felt like I had walked
out into some strange land where dead sharks are a natural feature
on the pavement.  I couldn't help but snapping a few photographs,
and some of the locals (who had also been photographing them) started
a conversation with me.  Apparently it's this busy every day,
and that if I think it's hot now, I should try coming back in August!
<p>
From the fish market I wandered along the foreshore, which seems to
be an extremely popular location if you're male and from south asia.
I got to see the port and some large cargo vessels, but it wasn't
particularly scenic.  I crossed the road and visited "Gold Mart",
since Dubai is renowned for its gold markets.
<p>
Gold Mart, as I was to discover, was not the Gold Souk, but a
collection of jewellery stores.  At this point I would discover that
a great many store owners thought I might like to buy a watch,
or a belt, or sunglasses, or numerous other items that I wasn't
interested in.
<p>
I left the Gold Mart, and a guy by the door assured me that he had
the greatest collection of pirated and counterfeit goods I could wish
for.  I walked down the street, and at every corner I was offered
a fake rolex for sale.  I eventually <i>found</i> the Gold Souk,
which really is awesome, but I could hardly move without someone
approaching me with offers of counterfeit merchandise.  To the
vendors' credit, they were always very up-front about the lack of
authenticity.
<p>
The Gold Souk is home to the world's "heaviest gold ring", which is
a glittering monstronsity that weighs about as much as I do.  It also
really does have a massive amount of gold on sale, in the form of
ingots, chains, rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and many other
forms.  It was <i>very</i> sparkly.
<p>
From the Gold Souk, I made my way back to the creek, and discovered
a stall specialising in perfumes and incenses.  As my mother-in-law
put in a special request to bring her back some frankincense, I
took the opportunity to investigate.  I could get a small amount for
5 dirhams, a reasonable amount (100g) for 15, or a huge amount (500g)
for 55.  I opted for huge, and haggling, and got the price down to 45
dirhams, about $15 for 500g.  I actually have no idea if that's
a good price, and probably should have haggled more.
<p>
With the frankincense in my inventory, and the hope that I can bring
it through customs in my head, I caught another water taxi across
the river, and walked back to my hotel.  On the way, I discovered
an Internet cafe close to my hotel that assured me I could plug in my
laptop, at the rate of 10 AED/hr (about AUD $3.30/hr).  While that's
more expensive than downtown Bur Dubai (2 AED/hr, or 4 AED/hr if you
want a seat), it's a lot less expensive than the paid hotspots (15
AED/hr), and considerably cheaper than the hotel (35 AED/hr).  I
suspect I'll be visiting that cafe a lot.
<p>
My day ends with blogging, coffee, and a soak in the bath.  With Day 1
of Dubai over, I've walked somewhere in the realm of 15km, and spent
about 100 dirhams (about $35 AUD), excluding the hotel.  Tomorrow,
I plan to visit the museum early, and then head south to new Dubai.

                <p><b>Saudi Arabian Adventures - Day 0</b><br>
<i>The events in this entry occurred on the 11th/12th June</i><br>
<p>
At the start of this year, Kirrily "Skud" Robert
<a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/01/01/new-years-resolutions/">made
a remark</a> about new year resolutions that are easy and fun to keep.
As an example, she included "never turn down an adventure".
<p>
While I'm not one to make (or keep) new year resolutions, this one
stuck in my mind as a particularly good one to have.  While it's certainly
been a <i>fun</i> resolution, I disagree about it being easy to keep.
It's this particular resolution that had me stripping off to go swimming
in <a href="http://pix.cafuego.net/main.php/v/Marchsouth/dsc_0003.jpg.html">
waters of unknown depth, quality, and temperature</a> when travelling
around Tasmania with <a href="http://cafuego.net/">Peter</a>,
<a href="http://kattekrab.net/">Donna</a> and
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">Jacinta</a> after
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> this year.
<p>
The same resolution of "never turn down an adventure" now has me in
Saudi Arabia, giving a Perl course to the world's largest oil company.
It would have been easy for me not to be here.  As it happens, I arrived
only a day before my entry visa expired.  The amount of legwork
required to set up a trip like this for the first time is quite
considerable, and actually started back in Feburary!  So far, it certainly
has been an adventure.
<p>
It started with my flight from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai">Dubai</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dammam">Dammam</a>.  Emirates was kind
enough to upgrade me to business class, which was nice, and meant a
very comfortable flight.  At the end of the flight I
leisurely strolled off the plane and through the airport, looking
at the scenery and taking my time.  When I rounded the last corner,
I immediately realised I had made a terrible mistake.  Despite the
flight having lasted only an hour, I had flown internationally, with
hundreds of other people.  There would be passport control and
customs.  These things are rarely quick, and one <i>really</i> wants
to be at the front.
<p>
I found myself about three-quarters down the back of a queue, with
only a small number of passport control officers.  I noticed that
processing each person took a <i>long</i> time, maybe five minutes or
more, as they needed document checks, and fingerprints, and
photographs, and sometimes a short interview, and (if they looked
unwell) a check by doctors concerned about swine flu.  It was about
10pm at night, and after counting the people in front of me, and doing
some maths, I estimated I would be through passport control at
approximately 2am!
<p>
As luck would have it, another passport control officer was put on
duty, and I managed to get through customs after only a
three-and-a-half hour wait.  There was then a rather ominous moment
of me realising that while there were lots of drivers waiting with
signs and people's names, none of them held <i>my</i> name.  Luckily,
my driver had only gone to get a cup of tea (quite understandable
after 3.5 hrs waiting!), and we met after only a few minutes of me
wandering about looking lost.
<p>
After chatting a bit with the driver, I must admit that I slept
most of the trip to the hotel.  It seemed to involve the single
longest stretch of road possible; I woke up a few times, and we
were still on the same highway.  It also had what I could only
describe as christmas-tree lights strung along the edges (so one
didn't drive off into the desert), and all the electronic signs
(eg, roadwork ahead) were animated in such a way that if one
ever appeared in my web-browser, I would immediately add it to my
block-list.
<p>
After going through a number of security checkpoints (which I would
later learn are required for all entry and exits to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco_Residential_Camp_in_Dhahran">Aramco campus</a>),
I finally arrived at my hotel.  This felt like being in America;
it had American power points, all the light-switches were the wrong
way around, and the lamps have these funny knobs that I keep turning
the wrong way.
<p>
At this point, most people would fall asleep, exhausted.  However I'm
equipped with the geek version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's
hierarchy of needs</a>, so the first thing I did upon arriving
was wake up the poor reception staff so I could be connected to
the wireless network, and <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/5205857">dent/tweet</a>
that I had arrived.

                <p><b>Dubai stopover</b><br>
I'm in Dubai for a 10 hour stopover between flights, and I'm loving
it already.  Having come from a very cold, very wet, and very dark
Melbourne, having a world that's bright and warm and humid is just
fantastic.  I'm itching to get to the beach, or walk across the
desert, or just go exploring generally.  I've already done some of
that in my local area, but I can't go too far as I still need to
get back in time to catch my flight.
<p>
Of course, getting into Dubai wasn't all fun and puppies.  The flight
was fourteen hours long, and while I had brought along sleeping tablets,
they seemed to work better at dulling my thinking while awake rather
than helping me sleep.  I don't remember sleeping on planes being
anywhere near this bad for my trips to the USA, but then again those
trips were done without me sleeping the night before.
<p>
Besides trouble sleeping, my biggest oops was forgetting that I
had brought <i>two</i> bags with me, rather than one.  Luckily,
the helpful Emirates staff were able to find my errant luggage,
and since Dubai airport has free wifi, I was happy to wait.
<p>
Customs seemed very relaxed, and while I was selected for 'additional
screening', that mostly consisted of chatting to the friendly
guard about how much extra battery life my laptop can get from
my external battery.  The best part was after the security guard
asked me to "step this way", he acknowledged that I had been on
a flight for 14 hours, and so if I wanted to duck out for a smoke,
that would be perfectly okay.  He looked very disappointed when I
said that I didn't smoke, and in hindsight <i>he</i> may have been
looking for an excuse to go to the smoking area. ;)
<p>
Currency conversion rates at the airport are nowhere near as bad
as they are in Australia, at least when converting from Aussie
Dollars to Saudi Riyals and UAE Dirhams.  Overall about 5% of my
money went on currency conversion, whereas in Australia it was hard
to find anyone who'd sell Riyals for less than 10%, plus waiting times.
<p>
The food so far has been excellent.  The aircraft food was tasty
(for aircraft food) and bountiful.  Emirates has given me a hotel
(quite spacious) at which to stay between my flights, and the hotel
comes with lunch (a huge buffet), dinner (an even bigger buffet), and
a "snack" (which looks like it's really "second lunch").  The food is
<i>really</i> good, there's a fantastic vegetarian selection, and
the service is excellent.  I can wholeheartedly say that I 
<i>like</i> the airport hotel.  ;)
<p>
My only problem with the hotel is that there are no tea or coffee
making facilities.  That's not a big downside, since I can always
walk downstairs with my "snack" voucher and be given a half dozen
cups of coffee, a pudding, a huge slice of cake, some very nice
freshly made creme caramels, and assorted morsels to "fill in the
edges".
<p>
Prices in touristy places seem about on-par with prices in Australia.
Prices outside of touristy places vary in my short experience with
them.  I went to a supermarket to refresh a few supplies, and found
fresh fruit and vegies at about the same prices in Australia.  However
the cans of coke and associated soft-drinks in the "impulse buy
fridge" were only 1 AED each, which is about $0.33 AUD.  Coffee at
the airport is the most surprisingly expensive, at the equivalent of
$7 AUD per cup!
<p>
Most ironic experience today was one of the locals pulling up in
his car and asking me for directions to the hospital.  Oddly enough,
I could give them, as I'd walked past the hospital on the way from
my hotel.
<p>
I'm now just about to hop on a flight to Saudi for my assignment
teaching Perl.  I may be out of Internet range for a while.

                <p><b>Teaching Perl in Saudi Arabia</b>
After what seems like an almost endless amount of paperwork, visa applications, immunisations, negotiations, contracts, travel agents, and administrivia, I'm about to fly to Saudi Arabia, to teach Perl to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco">the world's biggest oil company</a>.
<p>
Why are they learning Perl?  Well, as best I can tell, they're using it for data munging of geological data.  That's got a familiar ring to it, in fact I've been seeing a big growth of <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=566">Perl in Geoscience</a> recently.
<p>
On the way back I'm planning to spend a couple of days in Dubai, just because it sounds like such a bizarrely opulent part of the world.  World's biggest hotel.  World's biggest indoor ski slope.  World's biggest shopping mall, and certainly the closest thing we have to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/magrathea.shtml">Magrathea</a>, with Dubai creating artificial islands in the shapes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands">palm trees</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(archipelago)">the world itself</a>.  I also hear the diving is pretty good.

                <p><b>My strange working habits</b><br>
After far too long on the road, I've been in Melbourne for a whole week.  In theory, I get to spend at least another 10 days here before my next flight, which (provided the last piece of paperwork gets signed) will be to Saudi Arabia.
<p>
This week, when it comes to interesting FOSS stuff, I've done absolutely nothing.  What I've discovered is that when I'm on the road, I keep squeezing in bits of work around the edges.  A lot of my coding gets done in departure lounges, and for my last trips to Canberra, on a bus.  However when I'm home, I can <i>relax</i>.  I can sleep in, be comfortable, and have <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/4712036">long, drawn-out breakfasts</a>.  I have friends, real ones, that I can see and spend time with.  In short, I have all the things of which I've been completely deprived while travelling.
<p>
While this is great for recharging my batteries, it's not great in terms of deliverable productivity.  If you're waiting on me to complete or review a piece of code, you have my most sincere apologies.  Feel free to keep nudging me, it does help.
