        <b>The night before OSDC</b><br/>
        Well, this is it.  After many months of planning, OSDC
        (aka YAPC::AU) is finally happening, tomorrow.  The committee
        will be starting setup at 7am, and that includes Jacinta and
        myself.  Tomorrow will be ending after the dinner, I'll
        be drinking a lot of coffee tomorrow.
        <p>
        Today was spent doing day-before setup at the facility,
        putting up signs, installing computers, and testing that
        <i>Frozen Bubble</i> works on the huge overhead projectors
        with thumping sound systems.  Perhaps I could challange
        Damian or Gnat to a game of Frozen Bubble as a lightning
        talk?  Perhaps all the stress of conference organising
        is finally sending me fruity.
        <p>
        For my part, I have everything ready, except for the traditional
        things, like my presentation and keynote introductions.  At
        least this is one conference where I won't need to pack a huge
        box of business cards -- as
        <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>
        are sponsors, everyone will be getting a business card in their
        conference pack.
        <p>
        I've got a bunch of photos of setup and organisers (while
        they're still smiling!).  They'll be going up when I get a
        a free moment with connectivity and no pressing tasks.
        <p>
        <b>Scuba Gear</b><br/>
        Big box of scuba gear arrived the other day.  Getting it
        through customers was interesting, they wanted to know
        what a 'tank bhan-ger' was used for.  Eventually (when I found
        my order sheet) I realised it was a 'tank bang-er'.  After
        a few more difficulties (why would you want to bang your tank?)
        I communicated it was an underwater signalling device,
        <p>
        After the conference I'm looking forward to popping down to
        Portsea for a day or two in order to test out all the new
        gear.  We've got some wonderfully over-engineered lights
        (primary filament, backup filament, backup light, and locator
        light), so I'm really looking forward to a night dive if
        we can squeeze one in.

                <b>Revision Control</b><br>
Goodness, sponsoring a conference is an awful lot of work.  There's
brochures to print, presentation folders to make, advertisements to
prepare to particular dimensons, speaking opportunities, and an awful
lot of text to write for everything.  On top of that add the regular
conference things like your own presentations, and stir in a number of
clients trying to spend their budgets before the end of the year, and
you end up with a particularly busy week.  There's a good chance that
something can be overlooked.
<p>
As developers and writers we all know the golden rule of working
together, or even just singularly.  Revision control, revision
control, revision control; and in my case a little coffee on the
side.  However during this hectic week of presentations, a mistake
was made.  I broke the golden rule.  When submitting one of our
advertisements, I submitted the wrong one.
<p>
Sure, there was a 30-minute deadline to get the advertisement to
the relevant people, and sure there was a conversion process in there
to get it into the preferred format, and yes this was at the end of
the day with other deadlines looming.  It's the perfect situation for
a mistake to be made, and that's why the golden rule of revision
control is all the more important.
<p>
In this particular case, I didn't know that the document had been
filed into CVS.  I knew that it <i>should</i> have been.  Jacinta knew
that too, and indeed had placed it into CVS into the most obvious
location, and updated it to the revised version that we actually
wanted to use.  Everything was there, I just didn't bother to type
<tt>cvs update</tt> to find out.

                <b>Wedding Anniversary, 1a</b><br>
I've been married for slightly more than 13 months now.  Jacinta and I
celebrated our real one year anniversary on the correct day, but aside
from a nice dinner and <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=324&amp;count=1">helping save the
life of a drug overdose victim</a> we didn't really do that much due
to work restrictions.  So we instead planned to have a second
anniversary -- one month and one day after our real one.
<p>
The plan was that we would take Friday off work, spend a little time
shopping for scuba equipment, and then head to the beach if
the weather was good, or plan something else enjoyable if it were
not.  Afterwards we'd drop into a Firefox celebration happening
that evening, have a nice dinner, and take advantage of a complimentary
stay with breakfast that was offered to us by the hotel where we had
our wedding reception a year ago.  It was going to be a wonderful
break from what's otherwise been an exceedingly busy and stressful
time.
<p>
Unfortunately, things didn't go quite as planned.  The
<a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">BoM</a> was tipping rain, so we
skipped on the day at the beach.  Instead we spent the entire day
working on formatting papers for the
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> proceedings.  Not technically
paid employment, but certainly not my idea of a romatic day together.
Still, we had the evening to enjoy.

<b>Childhood dream fulfilled</b><br/>
Like many other eight year olds, I was caught up in the <i>Ghostbusters</i>
craze some twenty years ago.  I watched the movie so often I knew most
of the script.  As a fledgling roleplayer I had the Ghostbusters RPG.
As an imaginative child I would procure many household items (vacuum
cleaners, turntables, radios, hairdryers) for conversion into
ghostbusting equipment, which (much to my parents chagrin) usually
involved them being disassembled and the electronics coated in cooking
oil to shield against ghosts.
<p>
I also had the Ghostbusters computer game, for the Commodore 64.
It was a good game for its era, although its primary selling points
were the song lyrics on the title screen, and two voice-synthesized
phrases: <i>Ghostbusters!</i> and <i>It slimed me!</i>.
<p>
Despite hours of play of the Ghostbusters computer game, I never
managed to complete it.  The last scene involved sneaking two
ghostbusters past the marshmallow man, and I could only ever get a
single one past.  I had heard tales of friends of friends who had
done it, but nobody I had actually met in the flesh.
<p>
Yesterday, on a whim, I grabbed a copy of Ghostbusters for my
emulator and tried my luck again.  As fate would have it, I got
past the marshmallow man on the very first game, with the very
first two ghostbusters.  My childhood dream was fulfilled.
<p>
Unfortunately, like many games of its era, the end-scene for
the Ghostbusters C-64 game was rather uninspiring.  A brief
and unexciting animation, followed by some written text which
amounts to a little more than <i>Congratulations, you have won</i>.
Regardless of the poor ending, I still feel superior over my peers
for having seen it.
<p>
<b>Breakfast dreams shattered</b><br/>
Awoke rather early today in preparation for a long trip across town
to visit an irregular client.  With some excitement I realised that
I woke early enough to allow me to comfortably make my favourite
breakfast: soft-boiled eggs with soldiers and espresso coffee.
<p>
Unfortunately, we were out of bread, so this dream never came to
fruition.  In hindsight I probably could have walked to the corner
store and picked up some bread rather than writing a journal entry
about things I thought were cool when I was eight, and what I was
planning to have for breakfast.

<b>Photos of The Damian</b><br/>
As part of our
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia's</a>
advertising campaign we're looking at adding pictures of our trainers
to both the website and a number of our advertising materials.  Since
we have a number of courses to be conducted by Dr Damian Conway early
next year (<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/bookings.html">bookings are
open</a>), Jacinta politely asked Damian for an appropriate photo.  To
quote from the e-mail that ensued:
