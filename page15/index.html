            <p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 3</b><br>
Today I decided to travel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumeirah">Jumeirah</a> beach and surrounds, a decision
I made purely based upon the number of tags and photographs in the
area for <i>Google Earth</i>.  Since I'd be doing this during
the day, I decided to take a practical approach.  I left the laptop
and most electronics back in the hotel, and packed lots of water
and sunscreen.  I wore my most breathable cotton top, a
<i>linux.con f.au</i> hat, and what Jacinta calls my "pirate pants".
These pants are very loose, and very breezy, and very comfortable.
But as a result, I didn't look like a local, and I didn't look like
a typical tourist, either.  I was, however, protected from the sun
and reasonably cool.
<p>
I caught a taxi to Jumeirah mosque, for just a little
over 10 AED (about $3.50).  I didn't expect to find the mosque open
(and indeed, it wasn't), but I got some nice photographs.  The main
reason I wanted to visit the mosque is that it was walking distance to
the beach, and (if you're me) Sheik Zayed Road.  While two days ago I
had discovered that walking around the old souks resulted in someone
trying to sell me a fake rolex every few minutes, today I discovered
that walking around Jumeirah had a taxi beep at me every few minutes,
hoping that I would need a lift somewhere.
<p>
Jumeirah beach is very pretty, and very hot.  There weren't many
people out, and a lifeguard watched lazily from a tower.  The beach
came with lots of rules, one of which was "strictly no cameras", 
so I had to be a little more discreet with my photographs.  The
water looked extremely inviting, and I relished the idea of hopping
in for a swim.  Unfortunately (and accidentally), I had left my
swimming gear back in the hotel, and my mask and snorkel back in
Australia.
<p>
At the beach I got some great photographs of the skyline of Sheik
Zayed Road, especially of the Burj Dubai, which distinctly reminds
me of the Combine Citadel in Half-Life 2.  Having looked around
the beach, I decided to head off toward Sheik Zayed road, which
I was certainly would be filled with marvels.
<p>
The walk was a lot harder than my previous wanderings around Bur
Dubai, even though the distance was shorter.  I was walking
through a residential distract, and as such there was a lot
less cover, and fewer amenitities.  It was clear that Jumeirah
was home to the rich, with magnificent mansions and expensive
cars.
<p>
After about 1.5km of walking from the beach, I was finding that
the heat and exposure was making me a little uncomfortable, and
that while I had packed a lot of water, I'd probably need to
think about looking for more.  Luckily, I had just chanced upon
a park.  It was beautiful, green, lush, and immaculately maintained.
For some reason, the gate was shut, with a large padlock, and it
looked as if this gate had been shut for some time.  Perplexed,
I went to a second gate, and it was also closed.  I noticed a
person in the park, but he appeared to be a groundskeeper, who
was distracted by talking on his mobile phone.  This had me even more
perplexed; why spend water, and money, and high-value property on
creating a park that nobody can get into?  This wasn't marked as a
private park, and it even had a playground in the middle of it.
Maybe it closed during the middle of the day, and re-opened later on?
<p>
A climbing check, and two stealth checks later, I found myself
a section of soft grass and a shady tree under which to snooze.
I woke after about half an hour, a little surprised that the
groundskeeper hadn't woken me.  Refreshed, I continued on my
way, and discovered much to my delight that Dubai has public
<i>refrigerated</i> drinking founains.  With my water bottles
refilled, and my face and arms splashed with blissfully cold
water, I continued onwards.
<p>
The region I was walking through seemed to be filled with
houses that were universally big.  However one house in particular
stood out.  It was on the corner of two streets and was unfinished.
That in itself is nothing special; Dubai seems to be in a constant
state of construction, but it was clear this building had been
unfinished for quite some time.  The shell was made, but that's
all which was there.  Amusingly, a sign on the side said "For Sale
or Rent".
<p>
After walking past another park (also beautiful, closed, and
deserted), I eventually reached Sheik Zayed Road.  This is the
home to many of the tallest buildings in Dubai, and is a spectacular
sight from the air, but amazingly dull on the ground.  These
were hotels, and office blocks, and the odd food outlet here and
there.  It was also completely impossible to cross on foot.  It
<i>looked</i> like some footbridges were under construction, but
they were nowhere near finished, and they were so big I suspect
they were for yet another road link, and not meant for pedestrian
traffic at all.
<p>
I walked down the street, and got some decent photographs.
My plan was to walk across to the Dubai Mall, take a look around,
and then walk up the other side of Sheik Zayed Road to the Emerites
Towers.  As it happened, try as I might, I couldn't find a way
to get across the street, which has twelve lanes, and cars travelling
at considerable speed.
<p>
Hot, disappointed, and tired, I decided to try and find someplace
cool, and preferably with restrooms.  Being Dubai, there was a small
mall not too far away, and I made my way toward it.  It had a
supermarket, and an electronics superstore, and in a rare moment
of impulse purchasing, I grabbed a copy of <i>EA Sports Active</i>
(which apparently sucks less than Wii Fit), after carefully checking
it for any signs that indicated that perhaps it would only work in
certain regions.
<p>
If I had my laptop with me, I would have pulled out my maps and
looked for interesting activities, but since it was not available,
and since I had gone all this way to discover that Sheik Zayed road
sucked, I hailed a taxi to get back to town.  This was one of the
best parts of the day, since the driver was very talkative.  He was
from Pakistan, to which he'd love to return, but apparently there are
no jobs there.  He had worked previously in the Ukraine, and had
moved to Dubai eight months ago.
<p>
My driver commented that Dubai is an artificial city.  It's got
artificial islands, artificial buildings, artificial snow, and
artificial parks.  People are here because Dubai has done an amazing
job of marketing itself to the rich, but due to the global financial
crisis, the rich aren't rich anymore, and they're flying back overseas.
Tourism is down, jobs are more scarce, and so many of the not-so-rich
who have come here for work are also going back overseas.  Apparently
all this was great reducing traffic congestion and getting me back to
my hotel, but it sucked for the city as a whole.
<p>
Back at the hotel I had a bite to eat, and wrote this blog.  My plane
leaves at 9:35am, which means I want to be at the airport at 7:35am,
which means I want to be leaving the hotel at 7am, which means waking
before that.  If I want to avoid too much jet-lag I should be going
to bed <i>now</i>, and waking super-early in the morning.  Instead I'm here posting blog entries, and discovering that the the UAE censors flickr, so there won't be any photographs until I get home.

            <p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 2</b><br>
I'm never going to be awake early in the morning so I can visit the
museum if I keep getting back to my hotel at 12:30am, and blogging about
my day.  And yet that's what I'm doing right now.
<p>
Today was my second day in Dubai, and I discovered that Dubai has
westerners, women, and arabs; they all hang out in the malls.  After
sleeping in again (goodness, I was tired), I decided to go to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mall_of_the_Emirates">Mall of the Emirates</a> (the one with indoor skiing in middle
of the desert), and then make my way by foot to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_al_arab">Burj Al Arab</a>
area, which I estimated was a 2.5 km walk, and hence pretty easy.
<p>
I caught a taxi, as the distance was much too far to walk, and I had no
idea which bus to catch.  I had a great chat with the taxi driver; he was
from Nepal, had moved to Saudi to work (not far from where I was
working), and was now in Dubai.  I asked if he had any family here,
and he laughed.  Apparently Dubai is so expensive, especially with
rent, there's no way he could support a second person; the plan is to
work here as long as he can stand it, and take his savings back home.
<p>
It seems that with the global financial crisis (GFC), while Dubai still has
lots of taxis, it's lacking the tourists who normally use those taxis.
The GFC and the drop in tourism is something I'd heard from a few sources
now, and it's clear that a lot of Dubai depends upon the tourist trade.
<p>
When I stepped into the Mall, it felt like stepping into America.  It
had American shops, American food, and American people.  Actually, as
I was to discover after talking to a few of them; the majority of the
westerners were from the UK.  Almost everything in the mall had prices
similar to what I'd pay back home, and like most malls, most of it
were things I had absolutely no interest in at all.
<p>
Luckily, I found one of my objectives for the day, and that was a free
wireless hotspot.  I eventually found the access point, it's just
outside the cinema, and the SSID is "yournetworkname".  I used it to
call home (again, hurray for VoIP), and after a good chat ran down
my laptop battery.  Unfortunately, I didn't bring my external battery
(it's heavy!), so any remaining communication had to be done via
a hand-held.
<p>
The other discovery I found in the mall was an arabic gift shop, which
was filled with local wares and tourists.  Amazingly, I actually
enjoyed browsing here; this certainly wasn't stuff I'd see in
Australia (or anywhere else), and the prices were extremely
affordable.  There was also a hilarious collection of art-work out the
front of the door.  Words can't do these justice, so you'll just have
to look at the photos (coming soon) and see.
<p>
I purchased a selection of gifts and while often it was easy for me
to say "$x will like this", I discovered that was very hard when
$x = 'jarich'.  Eventually I went for the shotgun approach, and got
her one of everything.
<p>
Somehow, after two calls home, some IM chats with friends, a selection
of gifts, some photographs of the ski slopes, and some chats with the
locals, it had got rather late, so I decided to set out on my walk.
This was made more challenging by the fact that my laptop had a flat
battery, and that's where my maps were located, but since the Burj
Al Arab is the world's tallest building, it's not hard to spot and
walk toward it.
<p>
I should correct myself there, it's not hard to spot.  Walking toward
it <i>was</i> hard, since there were huge multi-lane highways, and
construction work, and no obvious way to actually walk there.  I could
(and in hindsight, <i>should</i>) have got a taxi there.  It would
have cost AED 10 (about $3.50), which would have been a bargain for
the XP I would have gained visiting it and the nearby Souq Madinat.
<p>
As it was, I ended up walking fruitlessly in what was essentially the
wrong direction.  Eventually I stopped for some food outside the
<i>Lulu Hypermarket</i>, where the serving staff of the fast-food
place I frequented were delighted that I was from Australia, and
gave me detailed information about the busses in the area, and were
generally awesome.  They were from the Phillipines, and collectively
were the nicest people I've met all trip.  It's just a shame the food
wasn't.
<p>
Having found the bus (AED 2 rather than AED 45 for a taxi), I looked
forward to being able to see all the huge towers along
<i>Sheikh Zayed Road</i>, which is the home of some of the most
opulent hotels and establishments.  Consequently, I was dreadfully
disappointed when it decided to go down Al Wasl Rd instead, which
doesn't have much sightseeing at all.  Eventually the bus pulled into
the Bur Dubai bus station, which I had never been to before, but which
I knew was walking distance from my hotel.
<p>
Unfortunately for me, I didn't know in which direction my hotel lay,
and due to an inefficient hashing algorithm being used in my brain,
I couldn't recall the name of the street with my hotel, either.
I knew I was staying in the Ramee Apartments, but apparently Ramee
is a chain with a number of Dubai hotels.  Plus, my laptop battery
was dead, so no checking maps for me.
<p>
Luckily for me, I was in Dubai, so I just walked across the road to
the mall (Dubai has plenty), plugged in my laptop, and fired up Google
Earth with all my cached maps.  The bus stop was only 600m from my
hotel as the crow flies.
<p>
On walk to my residence, down a surprisingly deserted street, a man
approached me from an alleyway.  From experience I figured this
probably meant he wants to sell me a <i>100% genuine fake rolex</i>,
although for a moment where I wondered if people get mugged in
these parts, and there was a reason nobody else was walking down this
street.
<p>
"Excuse me, but do you speak French?"  Okay, I <i>really</i> didn't
expect that.  I admitted I didn't, and wondered where this
conversation would go.  "Oh.  Then do you have a hotel?"  I started
to wonder if French-speaking, homeless tourists were common in these
parts.  "Yes, I have a hotel.  I'm walking there now."
"Oh.  Are you sure?  Because if you need a room, I have a room you can
rent.  It's very nice."  "No, really, I do have a hotel."  "Oh, okay,
where are you from?"  "Me?  Australia.  How about you?"  "I'm from
France."
<p>
Suddently, the conversation made sense.  My new acquaintance was over
here working, and with rent prices being so high, he was looking for
a room-mate.  He would have been most happy with someone who could
speak French, but I'd do.  If I was unhappy with my hotel, or sticking
around in Dubai, he'd be happy to split the room costs with me, 50-50.
<p>
We had an interesting chat, and I pointed that I could see my hotel
and was about to turn down one of the streets toward it.  We wished
each other a good night, and I dropped past the 24 hour
<i>Super Happy Mart</i> to replenish some supplies for breakfast.
<p>
Tomorrow I should try to wake up early and visit the museum, but based
on prior experience I'm not sure if I will.  Failing that, my plan is
to catch a bus or taxi to <i>Jumeirah Mosque</i>, check out the beach, and
then walk through the back-streets of Al Bada to Sheikh Zayed Road,
which should put me in the heart of the "down-town district".  I'm sure
I can find myself some trouble from there.  ;)

            <p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 1</b><br>
<i>I'm posting my adventures out-of-order, apologies for any chronological confusion caused.  The events in this blog post happened yesterday.</i>
<p>
Last night I flew back to Dubai after my stint teaching Perl in
Saudi Arabia.  On the flight one of the Emirates stewards recognised
me from my Australian flight, and we shared a few friendly words.
Another seemed to take a shine to me and somehow produced the best
coffee I've had all week; I suspect they have an espresso machine
hidden away somewhere that they only bring out for special occasions.
As such, even though my flight arrived at 2am, I was awake and happy.
<p>
Dubai airport has free wireless, which is something I am deeply
grateful for.  Using the amazing power of VoIP I called home (where
it was a sensible time), and had a lovely chat with Jacinta.
Amusingly, the call cost me much less than if I were in Australia
making the same call from a mobile.
<p>
Eventually, with my e-mail updated and my social meter refilled,
I caught a taxi to my hotel.  It's a three-star apartment hotel in
the Bur Dubai district, which I had picked because it was cheap,
and looked like it was close to busses, souks, and the museum.  I
arrived, and pretty much collapsed into bed.
<p>
The hotel is right next to a mosque, and I had heard from a few
reviews that one can expect to be woken up with the call to prayer.
Sure enough, a few hours after I had gone to sleep, I could hear
soft, dulcet tones calling the faithful to awake with the first light
and gather for prayer.  I stirred only a little and smiled; the
call was very soft, and very musical, this wouldn't cause me to
lose any sleep at all.  Then the mosque outside my window started
its call to prayer, with the volume cranked to eleven.
<p>
Looks like I'll be waking at first light tomorrow.
<p>
The hotel itself been really good.  Being an apartment-hotel, I have
cooking facilities, the most important for me are a kettle and
microwave.  It also has a washing machine, and I've taken the
opportunity to wash some of my clothes.  My biggest complaint is
that like many hotels, it <i>does</i> have in-room Internet access,
and it costs a fortune.  There also seems to be an expectation that
guests leave their keys at reception when leaving the hotel (maybe
people have lost or disappeared with them?), but since nobody has
taken the time to explain that to me, I've been taking my keys with
me.
<p>
Today I woke reasonably late, enjoyed a long hot shower, and
prepared myself some maps to help me get around.  I'd figured that
on my first day I'd explore the local district (old Dubai), and on
the second day I'd explore further away (new Dubai).  A few people
had mentioned that walking in Dubai in the middle of the day is
unwise, but I like walking, and I like hot weather, so how bad can
it be?
<p>
About 45'C (113'F) and <i>humid</i> is the answer.  I had packed plenty of
water, and stuck to the shade, so I got a few good hours of
walking in before I decided to find a bus-stop for a rest.  Bus-stops
in Dubai are wonderfully civilized, since they're air-conditioned.
Unfortunately mine didn't have wireless access.
<p>
The main problem with trying to see Bur Dubai during the middle of
the day is that everyone else is smart enough to go and do something
else when it's that hot, and so with the exception of lunch venues and
supermarkets, eveything was closed, even the malls!  This was a bit
of a disappointment as I had found the museum, but it was also closed.
I hope to get in early tomorrow.
<p>
While I was in Saudi Arabia, my colleagues there told me that more
foreigners live in Dubai than locals.  I now believe them!  Exploring
Bur Dubai felt more like exploring India.  I too was obviously
something peculiar; I was a westerner, I had long hair, and I was
walking in the middle of the day in Dubai.  Any one of those
attributes was out-of-the-ordinary, so at times I felt that I was
positively head-turning.
<p>
To be honest, I enjoyed the attention.  Most of what I was were
smiles; a few people asked where I was from, and what it was like
in Australia, and why I was walking in the middle of the day when
everyone sensible was out of the sun and having a rest.
<p>
Walking through Bur Dubai took me to the fabric souk, but most of it
was closed.  I'm not much of a clothing/fabrics person, so that didn't
bother me too much.  It also took me to Dubai Creek, which is a
fascinating and enchanting throng of activity.  Water taxis dart
back and forth, larger dhows and other vessels travel up and down,
and somehow nobody collides with anyone else.
<p>
From here I returned to my room and had a snooze, but my evening
walk took me back to the creek.  I took a water taxi across for
the standard fare of 1 dirham (about $0.30), and set out to explore
Deira, the old parts of Dubai north of the creek.
<p>
In Bur Dubai, there were an endless number of shops.  I walked along
"Computer Street" and past "Bank Street" in my travels.  I found
streets that were filled with eateries, and filled with clothing
stores.  In Deira, the streets were also filled with shops, but it
felt like they had been randomly generated.  There's be stores
selling mobile phones, car tyres, bedding, motorcycles, computers,
food, movies, whitegoods, furniture, electronics, beauty products,
and fish, all next to each other.  Many seemed to have equally
random names, my favourite of which was "Moist Flower Electronics".
The streets were twisty-turvy little things, and I soon found myself
lost, and not for the first (nor the last) time that day.
<p>
I don't really mind being lost in other cities.  It means I get to see
things I didn't plan, and in Dubai in particular, I can always hail
a taxi to take me back to my hotel.  So I continued onwards, hoping
to find the Gold Souk that I had marked on my map, but really happy
with anything.
<p>
I eventually found myself at the Hyatt hotel and its attached mall,
because I wanted a break from the heat, and I had discovered my
map of Dubai had lacked public toilets.  Inside the mall was an
ice-skating rink, and while I didn't skate, it sure was nice to
be in a cool environment again.  Most other things were closed, so
after I had made myself more comfortable, I decided to go exploring
again.
<p>
Without too much travel, I found myself at the Dubai fish market,
a place which I was able to discover by its unique scent alone.
In Australia, I'm used to fish markets generally being indoors, and
air-conditioned.  I think the market had one air-conditioned
building, and that was filled with people in the process of preparing
the fish for sale (sorting, gutting, filleting, etc).  Most of the
other stalls had generous amounts of ice to keep the fish cold.
<p>
I honestly can't do the fish market justice with words.  There are
people <i>everywhere</i>.  There are fish, <i>everywhere</i>.  The
quantity of fish and people dwarfed anything I've seen in Australia.
<p>
The most striking image of the market was outside, where a huge line
of sharks were lined up outside; I can only assume for transport,
since nobody seemed to be buying them.  While it appeared that were
once on ice, the ice had since melted, so it felt like I had walked
out into some strange land where dead sharks are a natural feature
on the pavement.  I couldn't help but snapping a few photographs,
and some of the locals (who had also been photographing them) started
a conversation with me.  Apparently it's this busy every day,
and that if I think it's hot now, I should try coming back in August!
<p>
From the fish market I wandered along the foreshore, which seems to
be an extremely popular location if you're male and from south asia.
I got to see the port and some large cargo vessels, but it wasn't
particularly scenic.  I crossed the road and visited "Gold Mart",
since Dubai is renowned for its gold markets.
<p>
Gold Mart, as I was to discover, was not the Gold Souk, but a
collection of jewellery stores.  At this point I would discover that
a great many store owners thought I might like to buy a watch,
or a belt, or sunglasses, or numerous other items that I wasn't
interested in.
<p>
I left the Gold Mart, and a guy by the door assured me that he had
the greatest collection of pirated and counterfeit goods I could wish
for.  I walked down the street, and at every corner I was offered
a fake rolex for sale.  I eventually <i>found</i> the Gold Souk,
which really is awesome, but I could hardly move without someone
approaching me with offers of counterfeit merchandise.  To the
vendors' credit, they were always very up-front about the lack of
authenticity.
<p>
The Gold Souk is home to the world's "heaviest gold ring", which is
a glittering monstronsity that weighs about as much as I do.  It also
really does have a massive amount of gold on sale, in the form of
ingots, chains, rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and many other
forms.  It was <i>very</i> sparkly.
<p>
From the Gold Souk, I made my way back to the creek, and discovered
a stall specialising in perfumes and incenses.  As my mother-in-law
put in a special request to bring her back some frankincense, I
took the opportunity to investigate.  I could get a small amount for
5 dirhams, a reasonable amount (100g) for 15, or a huge amount (500g)
for 55.  I opted for huge, and haggling, and got the price down to 45
dirhams, about $15 for 500g.  I actually have no idea if that's
a good price, and probably should have haggled more.
<p>
With the frankincense in my inventory, and the hope that I can bring
it through customs in my head, I caught another water taxi across
the river, and walked back to my hotel.  On the way, I discovered
an Internet cafe close to my hotel that assured me I could plug in my
laptop, at the rate of 10 AED/hr (about AUD $3.30/hr).  While that's
more expensive than downtown Bur Dubai (2 AED/hr, or 4 AED/hr if you
want a seat), it's a lot less expensive than the paid hotspots (15
AED/hr), and considerably cheaper than the hotel (35 AED/hr).  I
suspect I'll be visiting that cafe a lot.
<p>
My day ends with blogging, coffee, and a soak in the bath.  With Day 1
of Dubai over, I've walked somewhere in the realm of 15km, and spent
about 100 dirhams (about $35 AUD), excluding the hotel.  Tomorrow,
I plan to visit the museum early, and then head south to new Dubai.

            <p><b>Saudi Arabian Adventures - Day 0</b><br>
<i>The events in this entry occurred on the 11th/12th June</i><br>
<p>
At the start of this year, Kirrily "Skud" Robert
<a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/01/01/new-years-resolutions/">made
a remark</a> about new year resolutions that are easy and fun to keep.
As an example, she included "never turn down an adventure".
<p>
While I'm not one to make (or keep) new year resolutions, this one
stuck in my mind as a particularly good one to have.  While it's certainly
been a <i>fun</i> resolution, I disagree about it being easy to keep.
It's this particular resolution that had me stripping off to go swimming
in <a href="http://pix.cafuego.net/main.php/v/Marchsouth/dsc_0003.jpg.html">
waters of unknown depth, quality, and temperature</a> when travelling
around Tasmania with <a href="http://cafuego.net/">Peter</a>,
<a href="http://kattekrab.net/">Donna</a> and
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">Jacinta</a> after
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> this year.
<p>
The same resolution of "never turn down an adventure" now has me in
Saudi Arabia, giving a Perl course to the world's largest oil company.
It would have been easy for me not to be here.  As it happens, I arrived
only a day before my entry visa expired.  The amount of legwork
required to set up a trip like this for the first time is quite
considerable, and actually started back in Feburary!  So far, it certainly
has been an adventure.
<p>
It started with my flight from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai">Dubai</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dammam">Dammam</a>.  Emirates was kind
enough to upgrade me to business class, which was nice, and meant a
very comfortable flight.  At the end of the flight I
leisurely strolled off the plane and through the airport, looking
at the scenery and taking my time.  When I rounded the last corner,
I immediately realised I had made a terrible mistake.  Despite the
flight having lasted only an hour, I had flown internationally, with
hundreds of other people.  There would be passport control and
customs.  These things are rarely quick, and one <i>really</i> wants
to be at the front.
<p>
I found myself about three-quarters down the back of a queue, with
only a small number of passport control officers.  I noticed that
processing each person took a <i>long</i> time, maybe five minutes or
more, as they needed document checks, and fingerprints, and
photographs, and sometimes a short interview, and (if they looked
unwell) a check by doctors concerned about swine flu.  It was about
10pm at night, and after counting the people in front of me, and doing
some maths, I estimated I would be through passport control at
approximately 2am!
<p>
As luck would have it, another passport control officer was put on
duty, and I managed to get through customs after only a
three-and-a-half hour wait.  There was then a rather ominous moment
of me realising that while there were lots of drivers waiting with
signs and people's names, none of them held <i>my</i> name.  Luckily,
my driver had only gone to get a cup of tea (quite understandable
after 3.5 hrs waiting!), and we met after only a few minutes of me
wandering about looking lost.
<p>
After chatting a bit with the driver, I must admit that I slept
most of the trip to the hotel.  It seemed to involve the single
longest stretch of road possible; I woke up a few times, and we
were still on the same highway.  It also had what I could only
describe as christmas-tree lights strung along the edges (so one
didn't drive off into the desert), and all the electronic signs
(eg, roadwork ahead) were animated in such a way that if one
ever appeared in my web-browser, I would immediately add it to my
block-list.
<p>
After going through a number of security checkpoints (which I would
later learn are required for all entry and exits to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco_Residential_Camp_in_Dhahran">Aramco campus</a>),
I finally arrived at my hotel.  This felt like being in America;
it had American power points, all the light-switches were the wrong
way around, and the lamps have these funny knobs that I keep turning
the wrong way.
<p>
At this point, most people would fall asleep, exhausted.  However I'm
equipped with the geek version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's
hierarchy of needs</a>, so the first thing I did upon arriving
was wake up the poor reception staff so I could be connected to
the wireless network, and <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/5205857">dent/tweet</a>
that I had arrived.

            <p><b>Dubai stopover</b><br>
I'm in Dubai for a 10 hour stopover between flights, and I'm loving
it already.  Having come from a very cold, very wet, and very dark
Melbourne, having a world that's bright and warm and humid is just
fantastic.  I'm itching to get to the beach, or walk across the
desert, or just go exploring generally.  I've already done some of
that in my local area, but I can't go too far as I still need to
get back in time to catch my flight.
<p>
Of course, getting into Dubai wasn't all fun and puppies.  The flight
was fourteen hours long, and while I had brought along sleeping tablets,
they seemed to work better at dulling my thinking while awake rather
than helping me sleep.  I don't remember sleeping on planes being
anywhere near this bad for my trips to the USA, but then again those
trips were done without me sleeping the night before.
<p>
Besides trouble sleeping, my biggest oops was forgetting that I
had brought <i>two</i> bags with me, rather than one.  Luckily,
the helpful Emirates staff were able to find my errant luggage,
and since Dubai airport has free wifi, I was happy to wait.
<p>
Customs seemed very relaxed, and while I was selected for 'additional
screening', that mostly consisted of chatting to the friendly
guard about how much extra battery life my laptop can get from
my external battery.  The best part was after the security guard
asked me to "step this way", he acknowledged that I had been on
a flight for 14 hours, and so if I wanted to duck out for a smoke,
that would be perfectly okay.  He looked very disappointed when I
said that I didn't smoke, and in hindsight <i>he</i> may have been
looking for an excuse to go to the smoking area. ;)
<p>
Currency conversion rates at the airport are nowhere near as bad
as they are in Australia, at least when converting from Aussie
Dollars to Saudi Riyals and UAE Dirhams.  Overall about 5% of my
money went on currency conversion, whereas in Australia it was hard
to find anyone who'd sell Riyals for less than 10%, plus waiting times.
<p>
The food so far has been excellent.  The aircraft food was tasty
(for aircraft food) and bountiful.  Emirates has given me a hotel
(quite spacious) at which to stay between my flights, and the hotel
comes with lunch (a huge buffet), dinner (an even bigger buffet), and
a "snack" (which looks like it's really "second lunch").  The food is
<i>really</i> good, there's a fantastic vegetarian selection, and
the service is excellent.  I can wholeheartedly say that I 
<i>like</i> the airport hotel.  ;)
<p>
My only problem with the hotel is that there are no tea or coffee
making facilities.  That's not a big downside, since I can always
walk downstairs with my "snack" voucher and be given a half dozen
cups of coffee, a pudding, a huge slice of cake, some very nice
freshly made creme caramels, and assorted morsels to "fill in the
edges".
<p>
Prices in touristy places seem about on-par with prices in Australia.
Prices outside of touristy places vary in my short experience with
them.  I went to a supermarket to refresh a few supplies, and found
fresh fruit and vegies at about the same prices in Australia.  However
the cans of coke and associated soft-drinks in the "impulse buy
fridge" were only 1 AED each, which is about $0.33 AUD.  Coffee at
the airport is the most surprisingly expensive, at the equivalent of
$7 AUD per cup!
<p>
Most ironic experience today was one of the locals pulling up in
his car and asking me for directions to the hospital.  Oddly enough,
I could give them, as I'd walked past the hospital on the way from
my hotel.
<p>
I'm now just about to hop on a flight to Saudi for my assignment
teaching Perl.  I may be out of Internet range for a while.
