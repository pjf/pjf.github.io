        <div class="p-summary">
            
                <p><b>Diving</b><br/>
On Friday Jacinta and I travelled to Portsea in order to get a few dives in.  We stayed at the Portsea Hotel, who informed us that while "we were not directly above the live band, some sound may travel".  It was true that we were not <i>directly</i> above the band, but if we were to have taken three steps into the corridor we would have been.  Luckily the live band was <i>very good</i>, and so I slept quite happily despite the walls vibrating around me until 1am.
<p>
In the morning (6am) I awoke and visited Dive Victoria, and discovered that the 9am dive we had intended to go upon was cancelled, so we could all go back to bed.
<p>
Later, after breakfast and buoyancy checks, we departed upon an 11am dive to a shallow (10-16m) reef out in the bay.  The dive went pretty well, but I didn't properly apply defog to my mask beforehand (meaning I had to clear it regularly), and Jacinta experienced a few minor difficulties.
<p>
The first dive got away late, and so there was a bit of running to-and-fro for our 1pm dive, particularly to get replacement tanks of air.  This dive was done in a kelp forest, and was one of the best dives I've ever experienced in Victoria.  A wide range of ascidians in a variety of colours, and blue devil fish <i>everywhere</i>.  I'm used to having to look into caves and under ledges with a torch to find a blue devil, not being able to swim nose-to-nose with them in open water.
<p>
Our third dive was at 3pm, and of course by this stage we had to keep a close eye on our nitrogen levels.  This dive was out to <i>Castle Rock</i>, a site that we'd dived a number of times before.  The water was lovely and clear, and we saw a cuttlefish near the start of the dive.  We were sharing the site with a number of new divers doing their open water, and we generally kept out of their way.  I sure hope their buoyancy skills improve with practice.
<p>
It's well known that heavy exercise (especially carrying around heavy tank and belts filled with lead) acts as a flavour enhancer for food, especially Mexican.  So on the way home we stopped by a fantastic Mexican resturant and finished our meals very quickly, not too surpising considering we had also missed lunch.  After dinner it was just a long and tiresome trip back home, and a morning of rinsing and cleaning gear to look forward to.
<p>
<b>Missing Rabbit</b><br/>
Our dear pet Rabbit, <i>Shadow</i>, hasn't been seen since Thursday evening.  It could just be that with the unusually warm weather he's been snoozing under the house, especially since he's now grown his winter coat.  However Shadow is a very companionable rabbit, and so takes many opportunities to check in on Jacinta and I, and distract us from whatever task we're performing to be petted.
<p>
We're a little concerned, because if something has happened to Shadow, we're not quite sure what it would be.

                <p><b>Still a roleplayer</b><br/>
Went to visit some friends yesterday.  Had a lovely BBQ, played dancing games later on during the evening, and drooled over some very nice maps and miniatures.  You know your friends are into roleplaying when you find a plushy-cthulu doll with their child's toys.
<p>
However the moment of true enlightenment came when it was realised that not only were we discussing accounting practices, but we were discussing accounting practices so we could write a <a href="http://toee.pjf.id.au/wiki/index.php/User:LedgerBot">bot</a> to automatically calculate <a href="http://toee.pjf.id.au/wiki/index.php/KittyLedger">ledger balances</a> in a <a href="http://toee.pjf.id.au/">wiki for a roleplaying game</a>.
<p>
The bot works pretty well, too. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/WWW-Mechanize-1.12/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm">WWW::Mechanize</a> is a wonderful thing.

The business that shipped me the wrong wetsuit have been very polite and up-front about their mistake, and are very willing to fix it.  I can keep my existing suit for a partial refund (tempting, since it's a really comfortable suit, and I want to go diving next weekend), or I can return it at their expense for a replacement, which unfortunately will take 2-3 weeks to arrive.
<p>
I'm choosing to return the suit, as it means I won't need to worry about finding a buyer for the old suit, and I also get relief from import duties as the second suit will be a replacement, not a new import.
<p>
In the meantime it looks like I'll be wrestling my way into tight and rigid hire suits, while Jacinta lounges around in her custom-fitted semi-dry.

                <p><b>New Wetsuit</b><br/>
Diving is an equipment-intensive sport.  Having your own equipment rather than using hire-gear has a number of advantages, including both comfort and financial.
<p>
For anyone putting together a kit of diving equipment in Australia one thing rapidly becomes clear.  The cost of equipment overseas is significantly cheaper than purchasing it locally.  This isn't restricted to just diving equipment, books, electronics, software, and other products are often significantly cheaper overseas.
<p>
Purchasing items from overseas has obvious economic benefits, but carries some risks and disadvantages as well.  Obviously postage is longer and more expensive, and there are import duties and taxes.  These are easy to quantify.
<p>
Some risks are more difficult to determine.  Obviously when purchasing anything to wear, the possibility of a mis-fit is high.  So when I examined the possibilities of importing a wetsuit, I put considerable thought into sizing and what to do in case something goes wrong.
<p>
Eventually it comes down to a matter of risk-vs-reward.  I'm very comfortable with risk, and can happily say that I've benefited from taking calculated risks on a regular basis.
<p>
Today the wetsuit arrived, and sure enough it fits &mdash; perfectly.  It's extremely comfortable, very flexible, but most important of all, it's the wrong suit.
<p>
Without going into too much detail, I had ordered what's called a <i>semi-dry</i> that has seals around the neck, wrists, and ankles.  The suit that had arrived was conspiciously missing these.
<p>
I've opened negotiations to work towards a resolution, but given the distances and timezones involved, I imagine that may take some time.
<p>
The worst case scenario is that I return the suit for a refund, and wear the costs of postage (potentially including duties and taxes).  However I'm hoping this won't be the case.
<p>
This does put a bit of a hole in our diving weekend that's coming up.

<p><b>The most time-consuming desert</b><br/>
I've long had an interest in edible plants.  Most fruit and vegetables that are eaten in modern times require easy harvesting and good shelf-life.   Most westernized consumers don't see anything beside these commercial crops.  There are plenty of wonderful things out there that can be cultivated, or simply found growing wild if you know where to look for them.
<p>
I regularly use some of the more tasty of wild plants in my cooking.  Fat-hen (Chenopodium album) is regularly cooked in omlettes; Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), chickweed (Stellaria media) and pigweed (Portulaca oleracea) are fantastic in salads.  There's even some wild artichoke thistles (Cynara cardunculus) growing in the area &mdash; these are delicious, although gloves are required for harvesting and preparation.
<p>
One of the most widespread of edible plants is blackberry nightshade (Solanum nigrum).  The leaves are edible when cooked, but most importantly the tiny black berries are sweet, and can be happily eaten raw.  Blackberry nightshade has almost a worldwide distribution, and a long history as a food plant.
<p>
Many people consider the berries of S. nigrum to be poisonous, probably because the plant shares some similar physical characteristics with deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), a plant which is thankfully not found in Australia.  This caution is quite sensible: belladonna is very poisonous plant indeed.
<p>
This weekend Jacinta and I decided to try our hand at making <i>blackberry nightshade mousse</i>.  This calls for a cupful of blackberry nightshade berries, and it should be noted that these things are <i>tiny</i>.  Finding sufficient numbers was easy (our garden has a number of plants), but harvesting and preparation was an incredible amount of work.
<p>
I think that Jacinta and I easily spent over an hour just removing the stalks from the berries, just to get a single cup. I've come to believe that there must be a better way of doing this, possibly by using a coarse-grained seive.
<p>
Once the berries were prepared, making the mousse was really very simple and fast in comparison.  Overall the result was definitely worthwhile; the mousse has a sweet and delicious fruity-berry flavour, and one cup of berries makes quite a lot of mousse.
